Chris Dalby,"The cotonavirus has caused sellers of contraband goods to run out of merchandise in Mexico City
SHARE
Contacts in China provide Mexican criminal groups with everything from counterfeit luxury goods to chemical precursors for making fentanyl. But with the spread of the coronavirus, shipments from China have dried up and the cartels are feeling the pinch.
In February, it emerged that La Unión de Tepito, which controls much of the sale of counterfeit goods across Mexico City, was facing pushback from businesses who said they could not make extortion payments as they were no longer getting shipments of illegal merchandise from China, MVS Noticias
reported
.
Since at least 2010, a group within La Unión de Tepito, known as “Los Marco Polos,” has been in charge of going to China with thousands of dollars in cash to secure counterfeit clothes, jewelry and accessories to be sold in the shops and markets of central Mexico City,
according
to La Silla Rota. This activity is as important economically to La Unión Tepito as drug trafficking, according to MVS Noticias.
But in recent months, Los Marco Polos have been grounded due to the coronavirus lockdowns, unable to travel to China and leaving businesses high and dry without alternative supply routes.

Mexico News and Profiles
In late January, the criminal group reportedly told shopkeepers that the journeys to China had been suspended. Some of these businesses, angry at paying for products they will not receive on time, have
allegedly
threatened to stop paying the extortion payments to La Unión de Tepito as a result. This situation is
unlikely to change
for several months, given the continued spread of the virus.
And this is not the only possible consequence for Mexico’s cartels. The Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación — CJNG) is reportedly also struggling to source chemical precursors from China to make fentanyl, the synthetic opioid which has caused thousands of deaths in the United States and Mexico alike.
On March 5, Mexican radio show
Nación Criminal
, citing a source within Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office, reported that the coronavirus had suspended the fentanyl supply chain with CJNG’s partners in China that are unable to deliver the precursors.
In response, the source said the CJNG may have to hike its prices and potentially lose clients to other competitors. In 2020, a wide range of criminal groups in Mexico has been
contesting
for the prized trafficking of fentanyl.
InSight Crime Analysis
The global lockdown due to the coronavirus appears to be hitting legal and illegal economies equally hard, but it is likely the supply chain troubles of La Unión de Tepito and the CJNG are only the beginning.
Criminal groups across the region will feel the squeeze.
Countries across Latin America are
shutting down
borders and preventing
air travel
, which is likely to significantly disrupt criminal economies like drug trafficking, contraband smuggling and human trafficking.
With most aircraft grounded, illicit drug flights that have
become
a mainstay of drug trafficking in the region may become easier to track.
This situation, set to last for several months, will test the resiliency of criminal structures. Much like legitimate businesses, large groups such as the CJNG, which
operate
across large areas of territory and across multiple criminal economies, will have a greater capacity to resist the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus.
SEE ALSO:
CJNG News and Profile
But especially in Mexico, where criminals groups have been vulnerable to
fragmentation
, groups like La Unión de Tepito, focused on one geographical area or reliant on fewer means of income, may struggle.
Yet criminal groups are nothing if not able to find opportunities in a crisis. In Honduras, after the
government
locked down the borders due to the virus, human traffickers, known as “coyotes,” raised their prices to help people and contraband get in or out of the country illegally, El Diario de Hoy
reported

Max Radwin,"Protests broke out in Bolivia last year in the wake of controversial election results.
SHARE
Since Bolivia’s botched elections in October 2019, numerous high-standing politicians and law enforcement officials associated with the Movement to Socialism (Movimiento al Socialismo – MAS) party have fled the country or come under criminal investigation. Here, InSight Crime presents a roundup of prominent MAS figures connected to asylum claims or criminal activity.
Evo Morales:
The former president is
accused
of sedition, terrorism and election fraud after last October’s failed elections mired the country in constitutional crisis and violent protests.
Morales was trying for an unprecedented fourth term, which over the years has relied on constitutional
loopholes
, controversial
referendums
and Supreme Court
challenges
.
Irregularities
denounced by the Organization of American States during the election and final vote count called his win into question, and ignited month-long protests from both sides that resulted in 35
deaths
.
Military personnel asked for Morales’
resignation
in November. After seeking asylum in Mexico, he organized protests and blockades against the interim government, according to a
video
publicized by officials.
After moving to Argentina this February, Morales announced his intention to run for a senate seat in Cochabamba—a prolific coca-producing area as well as MAS stronghold—but was deemed
ineligible
by Bolivia’s Superior Electoral Court (Tribunal Superior Electoral – TSE) in February.
No official drug trafficking charge has been issued against Morales under this interim government, but conservative Deputy Tomás Monasterio submitted an official
request
that the DEA—which Morales expelled from the country in 2008—return to investigate his past involvement.
Álvaro García Linera:
The former Vice President is
accused
of election fraud. Prosecutors told
local media
that with Morales, García ordered the Deputy Ministry of Institutional Transparency to “manipulate electoral records.”
García had served with Morales since he took office in 2006. He is currently
living
in Argentina under political asylum status.
Héctor Arce:
The former Minister of Justice is being investigated for electoral fraud and corruption. Prosecutors
said
more than thirty former officials have come forward claiming that Arce ordered
them to alter and
falsify
electoral records at odd hours during the election.
Because the interim government has not approved his asylum claim, Arce currently
resides
in the Mexican embassy in La Paz.

Major Odebrecht Corruption Cases and Investigations in 2019
Juan Ramón Quintana:
The former government chief of staff is being investigated for
election fraud
and corruption, as well as
sedition
and terrorism.
A raid of Quintana’s home in December uncovered
evidence
that the head of a Bolivian gold exporting company had paid Quintana to help finance protests against Morales’ ouster.
No longer insulated within a MAS-controlled government, Quintana is the focus of several renewed investigations from his earliest days in office. One has to do with the illegal donation of vehicles to the
A
bya Yala Foundation
, a government contractor.
Another
involves his participation in a notorious embezzlement
case
that saw 121 million Bolivian pesos (about $17 million) lost to Indigenous Development Fund
“ghost” projects
between 2009 and 2013.
Quintana currently
resides
in the Mexican embassy in La Paz, as
the interim government has not approved his asylum claim.
Luis Arce:
The former economy minister is being
investigated
for his involvement in the Indigenous Development Fund embezzlement case.
Arce is currently
campaigning
on the MAS presidential ticket for the May 3 elections.
Carlos Romero:
The former interior minister is being
investigated
for electoral fraud and corruption.
In January, Romero was
arrested
after
failing
to appear in court to address irregular contracts with companies that supplied helicopter and airplane parts to the Executive Unit for the Comprehensive Fight Against Drug Trafficking (Unidad Ejecutora de Lucha Integral Contra el Narcotráfico – UELICN).
Romero is also
tied up
in
a handful of
small-scale investigations involving police coverups and drug trafficking.
One
connects him to the
plane
detained in Mexico carrying 1,225 kilos of cocaine.
Maximiliano Dávila
:
The former National Director of the Special Forces for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking (Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotráfico – FELCN) is being
investigated
for
drug trafficking
and corruption.
The investigation comes in response to a November
letter
published by Bolivian drug trafficker Pedro Montenegro Paz, now extradited to Brazil, that accused Dávila of doing bidding for former President Morales.
“(Dávila) did not rest until he destroyed everything within his reach,” Montenegro wrote, “and
for a series of interests creating smokescreens and putting himself at the service of a narco-government tyrant.”
Dávila was tasked with running the country’s top anti-drug agency
last February
. In that short time, he found himself caught up in numerous criminal scandals. The largest alleged his involvement in the disappearance of 35 kilos of cocaine during a May
drug raid
. Former colonel and convicted drug trafficker Gonzalo Medina called him “the true drug trafficker” of Cochabamba, but Morales defended his FELCN chief and no investigation was carried out.
It was not until October’s failed elections that voices outside of the drug trafficking world began to corroborate some of the accusations against Dávila. In November, FELCN officials requested his resignation due to corruption and unethical ties to the Morales government.
“Dávila has worked closely with Carlos Romero…and now works underneath ex-authorities in this conflict,” their request
said
. “We have information that this colonel has always answered to Evo Morales, has always been faithful to the former president.”
The interim government is also
investigating
the possibility that Dávila was present at Guayaramerín airport when a plane carrying 1.225 metric tons of cocaine departed for Mexico.
Felipe Cáceres:
The country’s former anti-drug czar is being
investigated
for his role in granting irregular contracts for UELICN helicopters and airplanes.
Additionally, Cáceres’ longstanding connections to coca-growing networks in the Chapare and influence over the country’s legal coca market in general make him vulnerable to investigations into his involvement in drug trafficking cases that were allegedly
buried
during the Morales government.
For example, former FELCN National Director Rene Sanabria implicated Cáceres in high-profile drug trafficking activity after being
arrested
by the DEA in 2011. At that time, the DEA couldn’t build a strong enough case against Cáceres, a DEA agent working the case told InSight Crime, due to its weakened relationship with the country.
Three days after Morales flew to Mexico, Cáceres applied for
political asylum
in Nicaragua.
InSight Crime Analysis
The reemergence of nearly ten-year-old cases and the ease with which officials have uncovered evidence in support of them suggests that MAS officials turned a blind eye to corruption, if not directly participated in it.
“We cannot allow our youth to be lost to drug trafficking,”
said
Interior Minister Arturo Murillo, an outspoken proponent of many investigations. “We cannot allow corruption to sink our country. For fourteen years, our country has lived in deep corruption, the free reign of drug trafficking, the free reign of crime.”

High-Ranking Bolivia Police Gave Protection to Wanted Drug Trafficker
Less than a month after Morales’ departure, the interim government
announced
the creation of the Anti-Terrorist Group (Grupo Antiterrorista — GAT) charged with patrolling the streets for “subversive acts” as well as freeing the country from
alleged “narco-terrorists
.”
Critics have pointed to GAT—as well as the astounding
600-plus officials
at all levels of the former government that are being investigated—as evidence of political persecution. A February congressional
declaration
criticized the interim government for partaking in “harassment, persecution and intimidation suffered mainly by leaders of social organizations and former authorities.”
Indeed, while reports of official involvement in cocaine trafficking and corruption were rife during Morales’ presidency, this targeted anti-MAS campaign raises questions about whether party officials partook in nearly unchecked criminal activity for more than a decade, or whether the new government is keen to tarnish its political opposition ahead of the general election in May.
Interim President Jeanine Áñez—a vocal critic of MAS who effectively rallied the Bolivian right during the protests—has
split
support for
non-MAS candidates, because former President Carlos Mesa, a moderate, is also on the ticket from last October. He appears to have a chip on his shoulder after losing to Morales, and has made
pushing
officials to broaden election fraud investigations all but part of his campaign strategy—especially for MAS candidate Luis Arce.
Nevertheless, a February
poll
showed that MAS still has the most support in Bolivia, with 31 percent. If a non-MAS candidate manages to fend off Arce, then expect investigations to dig even deeper than they have in the last few months. Otherwise, they may fade away like before.

Josefina Salomón,"43 people have been violently killed in Rosario since the start of 2020
SHARE
A wave of violent murders in Argentina’s strategically located city of Rosario has exposed a deeply fragmented criminal landscape and the urgent need for deep reforms to tackle police corruption.
Since the start of 2020, over 50 people have been
violently murdered
in Rosario, according to official figures reported by Clarín. This is particularly noteworthy since the homicide
rate
in Argentina as a whole is among the lowest in Latin America.
While street crime is behind
some of the murders
, many are believed to be the result of drug trafficking organizations
fighting for control
of the expanding local market, Telam reported.
Among those
killed
were Agustina Thomson, a young woman with a drug trafficking record who was shot three times in the chest, Dora Ercilia Quiroga, a mother of six who was caught up in the crossfire of a confrontation between two drug trafficking gangs, and Ángel Adrián Avaca, the son of a former police officer convicted of colluding with
Los Monos,
one of the most influential crime organizations in the country.
One of the most talked-about incidents took place on February 17, when Cristopher Albornoz, the son of Miguel Ángel Albornoz, alias “Caracú,” a
convicted
drug trafficker, was shot dead while riding a motorcycle. Cristopher’s partner and one-year-old daughter were also killed in the incident, La Nación
reported
.
SEE ALSO:
Argentina News and Profiles
Germán Montenegro, Security Secretary of the province of Santa Fe,
told
Telam that the violence is directly related to the “emergence of second or third-level leaders” of crime organizations after their bosses were put behind bars or “new groups that are fighting over control of the territory.”
Rosario’s strategic location is a tactical stop for drug traffickers, situated along the from
Bolivia
and
Paraguay
to the capital Buenos Aires, home to a
large consumer market.
Over time, an internal
consumer market
has also developed in the city. Since the leaders of Los Monos were
jailed on drug trafficking charges in 2018,
a number of groups large and small have been fighting to control it, often using deadly violence and colluding with local police.
InSight Crime Analysis
Although violence is not uncommon in Rosario, the recent spike in murders has revealed a power vacuum that many are trying to fill and in which the police are too complicit unable to stop.
For decades, local drug trafficking organizations co-existed in the city, each controlling a specific market, often working side by side with local police.
But the
killing of a prominent drug trafficker
in 2013 kickstarted a bloody fight between two clans that ended with dozens of criminals and
police officers
who worked with them, behind bars.
The purge of the police didn’t stop there.
In May 2019, the chief of federal police in Santa Fe and five other officers were
arrested
on drug trafficking charges after investigators found nearly 100 bags of cocaine, confiscated from a local drug dealer, in their offices as well as large sums of cash in their homes.
Experts consulted by InSight Crime say the recent convictions of high profile criminals and the ongoing purge in the police has left a power vacuum which has become fertile ground for violence.
“The confrontations today are led by the ‘middle managers’ because the leaders are behind bars. These don’t have links with the new police officers who replaced the old ones after the purge. Without the police, organized crime cannot function. The police provide them with information, logistics and a certain sophistication that these local groups don’t have,” Germán de los Santos, a journalist and investigator told InSight Crime.
On the other hand, police officers face work
conditions
that make them easy targets for criminal groups willing to offer them easy cash to look the other way or participate in drug trafficking.
The result of this process is that both the authorities and criminal organizations are effectively competing for the attention of police officers, who are likely to side with whoever can give them what they need.
De Los Santos said that local organizations take advantage of that chaos to “try and control new territory, using violence”.

Local authorities say they are working to reform the police.
“We have developed a plan that will be reflected in a series of bills aiming to restructure the police into a professional force, with an independent investigations unit, and an external body to control corruption within the force,” Germán Montenegro, security secretary for the province of Santa Fe
said
in an interview with Telam.
At the national level, Argentina’s Security Minister Sabina Frederic has also emphasized the need for
deep reform
of the security forces, including recruiting more police officers and investing increased resources into criminal investigations.
While there’s an undeniable need to restructure police forces, tackling entrenched and historical police corruption will require a long-term commitment from present and future administrations, an ask that has
proven challenging
in Argentina.

Parker Asmann,"Panama is still struggling to shake its reputation as a money laundering haven
SHARE
A new report says that Panama remains a nation of “particular concern” when it comes to financial secrecy and money laundering, suggesting that the Central American nation hasn’t quite kicked it’s reputation as a haven for washing dirty money.
Panama placed in the top 15 of countries around the world with the highest rates of financial secrecy and was the
most secretive nation
in all of Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Tax Justice Network’s
Financial Secrecy Index
for 2020.
(Graphic c/o
Tax Justice Network
)
Using
a combination of
qualitative data like laws and regulations to generate a secrecy index and quantitative data to create a weighted global scale, the report concluded that Panama “remains a jurisdiction of extreme concern,” with the country’s top ranking underscoring the “harmful nature of [its] offshore activity.”
However, on a global scale, the index noted that Panama accounts for “just 0.22 percent of the global market for offshore financial services,” making it a “small player compared to other secrecy jurisdictions” like the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong, among others.
In addition to having more than 350,000 secretive international business companies, the report found that the country is “active” in forming “tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration,” all of which violate financial secrecy laws.
InSight Crime Analysis
Panama has for years been slammed by international organizations for being “vulnerable to money laundering from a number of sources including drug trafficking and other predicate crimes committed abroad such as fraud, financial and tax crimes,” according to a
2014 report
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
However, in early 2016, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
removed Panama
from its “grey list” of countries particularly vulnerable to money laundering, noting that authorities had “established the legal and regulatory framework” to meet its commitments to right shortcomings identified by the task force.
Still, the latest report suggests that Panama is still failing to live up to its pledge to combat financial secrecy and the flow of dirty money through the country. Just last year in February 2019, for example, the European Commission
blacklisted Panama
along with 22 other countries around the world as having “strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering [and] counter terrorist financing regimes.”
SEE ALSO:
Panama News and Profile
“Dirty money is the lifeblood of organized crime and terrorism,” said Věra Jourová, the EU’s then Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. “I invite the countries listed to remedy their deficiencies swiftly.”
That said, Panama may soon be on the verge of turning a new leaf with the recent election of President Laurentino Cortizo in 2019. “We come from a lost decade of corruption and improvisation, of stealing money from Panamanians,”
Cortizo said
upon taking office. “There will be no untouchables, even if they are ministers, deputies and big businessmen, starting with the president himself.”

Juan Diego Cárdenas,"The launch of InSight Crime and Universidad del Rosario's report on Women and Organized Crime in Bogotá
SHARE
A new study is seeking to address the complex and rapidly evolving roles that women play in criminal structures, which have often gone underreported or been simplified in both academia and the press.
In this
report
, “Women and Organized Crime in Latin America: Beyond Victims and Victimizers,” Universidad del Rosario and InSight Crime’s Colombian Organized Crime Observatory seek to explore this fascinating dynamic.
*Download the “Women and Organized Crime in Latin America: Beyond Victims and Victimizers” report
here
.
This report looks at three criminal economies, drug trafficking, human trafficking and migrant smuggling to reveal that women often play myriad roles at the same time, ascending to power or wielding influence in a range of manners.
On the one hand, it is true that many women remain in criminal roles with low responsibility assigned to them by largely male leaders, such as working on coca farms or in drug labs, acting as drug mules, recruiting victims for human trafficking rings, organizing logistics or taking part in microtrafficking.
The dangers involved in these roles have driven the rapid increase in the incarceration of women, which increased by 52 percent worldwide between 2009 and 2019.
SEE ALSO:
Gender and Organized Crime News
But this is not the full picture. In this report, InSight Crime and Universidad del Rosario include profiles of some of the important women in organized crime in the Americas, many of them linked by a common thread: the use of violence.
When beginning or ascending up the ranks of a criminal enterprise, violence is a tool that women have used – to a greater or lesser extent – to achieve their mission. And the profiles of criminal leaders from Colombia, Guatemala and México in this report show what use they made of it.
One of this effort’s main goals is to show that organized crime is not merely a male environment, but that gender largely defines the activities and roles women and men take on.
The report was launched at an event in Bogotá, Colombia on March 9, with its research coordinator and professor at Universidad del Rosario, Arlene Tickner, explaining what made this avenue of research so worthy of exploration.
“We have a paradoxical situation in which women are increasingly assuming roles in different facets of crime. However, the issue remains unnoticed within academic research and public policy in Latin America,” said Tickner.
For her, one metric shows why this phenomenon needs to be analyzed: the constant rise in female incarceration rates across Latin America for the last decade, with many of these women having been imprisoned for minor crimes related to drug trafficking.
This joint report tells how most of these women come from poorer socio-economic backgrounds, have little formal education and have few formal job opportunities due to gender stereotypes.
In addition, according to Tickner, women have been seen largely as victims of organized crime for decades, especially in the realms of human trafficking and drug trafficking. This has led to the falsehood that even if they do participate in criminal acts, they are assumed to play only subordinate, non-violent roles.
In order to overcome these obstacles, it is necessary to understand the participation of women through a gender lens, Tickner said, in order to prevent gender stereotypes from clouding the full understanding of organized crime.
Regarding what Colombian authorities are doing, Lieutenant Colonel Lurangeli Franco from the Police Unit for Peace Building (Unidad Policial para la Edificación de la Paz – UNIPEP) said that the police’s Information System for Criminal Policy was the country’s first major effort to address the participation of women in criminal economies.
She added that the “recommendations of this investigation should be used to help transform Colombia’s security and justice sectors to make them more sensitive to gender issues.”

Leadership Role of Women Often Overlooked in Mexico’s Organized Crime Landscape
For Miguel Serrano, head of territorial studies for the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)’s Illicit Cultivations Monitoring System (Sistema Integrado de Monitoreo de Cultivos Ilícitos – SIMCI), this report helps to break down the roles women play within criminal organizations.
Serrano focused on the investigation’s findings about women entering criminal structures willingly. Research into female Colombian prisoners in 2019 found that at least 24 percent of women had begun participating in crime of their own will.
But he added that such investigations faced the same challenges as other reports into organized crime, namely that the underground nature of these criminal economies makes it difficult to fully realize the participation of women.
Finally, Irina Cuesta, a researcher of conflict dynamics at Colombia’s Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundación Ideas para la Paz – FIP), stressed that cultural stereotypes about the roles women play in organized crime had inevitably influenced previous research in this area.
While praising this new report for breaking down the division between victims and victimizers, she said that it also showed that “secondary roles” played by women in criminal groups, such as logistics, are more complex than previously thought.
In her closing statement, Tickner responded that the blurred lines between victims and victimizers were crucial to understanding the decisions women take in organized crime structures. According to the Universidad del Rosario professor, while women in leadership positions may feel “empowered,” this does not eliminate the possibility of them having been victims in the past or becoming so again.

Juan Diego Cárdenas,"With park rangers leaving their posts, deforestation is likely to run rampant in Colombia's rainforest
SHARE
Continued threats by criminal groups have led park rangers in Colombia’s protected areas of the Amazon rainforest to abandon their posts, leaving these territories to fall under the control of gangs.
In February 2020, at least 20 rangers left their posts in the national parks of Chiribiquete (Caquetá and Guaviare), Cahuinarí (Amazonas), Yaigojé Apaporis (Amazonas), La Paya (Putumayo) and Puré (Amazonas) after reportedly receiving threats by dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), also known as the
ex-FARC Mafia
, Colombian
media
reported.
The groups warned the rangers to leave these territories or be killed.
“Your presence is not needed because we will take care of the environmental controls. We already have the respective manuals on resource management, fishing, hunting and felling of timber. We do not want national parks here,” was the
message
that members of the ex-FARC Mafia’s Carolina Ramírez Front delivered to park rangers in Chiribiquete national park, Semana
reported
.
And these are not hollow threats. Yamid Silva, a ranger in the El Cocuy Park in the department of Boyacá, was
murdered
in early February.
According to a
November 2019
report
by Mongabay, armed groups pursue a range of criminal economies in these protected areas, especially illegal logging. Since 2017, legal and illegal groups have led deforestation campaigns in the departments of Meta, Magdalena, La Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Antioquia, Córdoba, Valle del Cauca and Nariño.
But criminal groups are not the only ones carrying out this activity. According to Colombia’s
Peace and Reconciliation Foundation
, “the protected areas and their respective buffer zones are subject to illegal burning and logging by rural farmers who are no longer stopped by an armed actor in the zone, nor by regulation.”

How Organized Crime Profits from Deforestation in Colombia
The rangers are left all the more vulnerable by the lack of a state presence in many of these remote parks. As InSight Crime has
reported
, other criminal activities in these parks include growing crops such as coca and marijuana, illegal mining and deforestation in order to build roads to facilitate the movement of illicit goods.
InSight Crime Analysis
With the rangers gone and other authorities unlikely to act in the parks, criminal groups can operate in these protected areas with increasing impunity, putting Colombia’s under-pressure natural wealth at risk.
Park officials in Amazonas — who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons — told InSight Crime that since the peace agreement with the FARC was signed in 2016 and the group demobilized, drug trafficking has spiked.
The Cotué, Amacayacu and Putumayo rivers, all of which traverse the parks, are mainstays for moving drugs and smuggled gasoline, used in drug processing and illegal mining.

In response, President Iván Duque’s government has launched a series of special operations, such as Operation
Artemisa
that deployed troops to take on these criminal networks and halt deforestation.
But while Artemisa, according to a government review in September 2019
cited
by Caracol, has destroyed over 400 coca processing labs and arrested a number of gang members, it has not landed a real blow to the presence of criminal groups in national parks.

According to figures from the Venezuelan government, 23 light aircraft and 36 clandestine runways used for drug trafficking
were either confiscated or destroyed
in 2019. But other groups monitoring the situation
claim
that the country has far more illegal runways and that planes carrying drugs
are seen
on a daily basis.
National Assembly representative Juan Pablo Guanipa was
quoted
by El Universal as saying that 400 such runways exist in the state of Zulia alone, where members of state security forces and of criminal groups allegedly force landowners to let them build landing strips. “If we denounce them, they jail us, or we simply have to leave the farm because of the threats,” one farmer in Zulia
told
El Pitazo.
One of the states where instances of landing strips and clandestine flights are most reported is Zulia. Located to the west of the country, bordering Colombia, the state is strategically located due to its proximity to Catatumbo, where
coca
production
has increased
.
Of the 36 clandestine runways destroyed by armed forces by August 2019,
31 were located in Zulia
, according to Venezuela government statements.

Drug Flights Coming Through Guatemala Continue to Soar
Beyond Zulia, InSight Crime has identified another five states where national and local media reports where the existence of clandestine runways or seizures of drug flights have been reported: Apure,
Amazonas
,
Falcón
, Guárico and Cojedes.
One Venezuelan pilot, Yazenky Antonio Lamas Rondón, who used to work for Venezuela’s first lady Cilia Flores and has since been extradited from Colombia to the United States, reportedly flew “over 100 drug flights” from the state of Apure to the Caribbean for a decade,
El Espectador
reported.
And in 2019, Spanish thinktank El Cano Royal Institute
showed
frequent drug flight connections from the Colombian departments of Guaviare, Guainía, Meta, Vichada and Arauca to the Venezuelan state of Apure.
Meanwhile, the central state of Guárico is reportedly being used to
house some of
the light aircraft used for these drug flights,
according
to El Pitazo. Over the last six years, a number of small planes have been seized in the national park of Aguaro Guariquito, where drug traffickers are believed to be
modifying
aircraft to allow them to carry heavier payloads.
Drug flights from Venezuela are bound for much of Latin America and the Caribbean, with evidence of them landing in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras,
the Dominican Republic, Belize
and even Mexico, as observed in distinct cases reported by
CNN
,
El Heraldo
and
El Universal
.
InSight Crime Analysis
Given Venezuela’s importance for transnational drug trafficking and the plethora of criminal groups involved in this criminal economy, the highest estimates for the number of drug flights and airstrips may be falling short.
Drug flights departed Venezuela every two days in 2017 and on a daily basis in 2018, according to statements made to
CNN
by a US government official. In 2019, this increased to five overnight flights
departing Venezuela on the same day.
Residents of Apure and southern Zulia have told InSight Crime that they frequently see small aircrafts flying overhead. Additionally, the presence of clandestine runways at many of the local farms is an open secret.

The role played by current or former members of the Venezuela armed forces is also worthy of note. In November 2019, an air force captain, Gino Alfonso Garcés Vergara, was linked to a complex drug trafficking plot involving who collaborated with Colombian and Mexican cartels, in a joint
investigation
conducted by Colombian police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
And in December 2019,
Guatemala shot down
a plane loaded with drugs that was illegally entering the country. The pilot, who was killed, was identified as Lino Nevado Sthormes, a former Venezuelan Air Force pilot from Maracaibo, in the state of Zulia.

SHARE
An increasing number of attacks on police in Uruguay shows that a growing organized crime threat may soon tarnish the reputation of what has long been one of the safest countries in the region.
In February, Uruguay’s m
inistry of the interior
published a
report
revealing that 78 police officials across the country were assaulted, with two being killed, during the first five weeks of 2020.
According to the government data, 25 of the attacks were violent robberies, and ten of them led to the officers’ firearms being stolen.
Police have three possible theories about the motives behind these robberies,
El Observador
reported, quoting police chief Mario Layera.
SEE ALSO:
Uruguay News and Profile
The first is gangs have begun paying members to assault agents in an effort to steal their weapons and
other police gear
, including
bulletproof vests
, uniforms and even
electronic equipment
from the ministry of the interior.
Another theory is these weapons are being moved to Brazil, where the demand for illegal arms is high.
Finally, Layera said the increase in weapons theft may be coming after the country increased its weapons seizures in 2019, leading to gangs needing to restock their arsenals, a theory which has also been
put forward
by former Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi.
InSight Crime Analysis
Uruguay has experienced a shocking rise in violence of late, including a 45 percent
spike in homicides
in 2018, and these latest targeted attacks on police suggest perpetrators can act with increasing impunity.
Police chief Mario Layera
has said
that while attacks on officers and theft of their weapons are not new, police response times and seizures of drugs and weapons from local gangs has
followed suit
. If true, this would add credence to the hypothesis that weapons theft has increased because the gangs have lost weaponry during police operations.
Meanwhile, Uruguay has long been seen as one of the few South American countries to not be plagued by extreme violence and the drug trade. Yet it is increasingly
an exit point
for drugs to Europe, and there is recent
evidence of its
armed forces colluding with gangs.

Security was a major topic during the country’s 2019 presidential campaign, including a national

on a security package that would have deployed the military into the streets and increased prison sentences for certain crimes. The referendum was not approved when it
did not receive a majority
of votes to pass, but around 47 percent of voters
were in favor.
New president Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou, who
took office
on March 1, has taken this public support for increased security to
announce
new measures, including more police patrols in dangerous neighborhoods and a crackdown on crime inside prisons and drug trafficking.

Eimhin O'Reilly,"The bullet-riddled car of Francisco Guízar Pavón in Puebla
SHARE
For over twenty years, Francisco Guízar Pavón consolidated an empire in central Mexico built on stolen fuel to become the “King of Gasoline” but his murder last month marked the latest casualty of the increasingly deadly illegal fuel trade.
On the morning of
February 21
, Pavón was shot at least eight times with a high-caliber weapon by unidentified assailants while driving through the upscale neighborhood of Lomas de Angelópolis, in the city of Puebla, south of Mexico City. Pavón’s murder comes just over three months after the
assassination
of his son-in-law, a deputy for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional – PRI) in the neighboring state of Veracruz.
In addition to his residence in Puebla, Pavón also owned several luxury properties in his native Veracruz, where he
founded his criminal enterprise
, according to Diario Cambio. A former employee of the Mexican oil giant Pemex, Pavón first delved into illegal gasoline – commonly referred to in Mexico as “huachicol” – when he was laid off in 1993. He soon amassed a considerable fortune by capitalizing upon his contacts in the oil industry, who would tip him off when gasoline was passing through the massive oil pipelines that cross the state.
Pavón, or “Pancho G” as he was known in his hometown of Tierras Blancas, gained a
reputation
as a Robin Hood-like figure, providing locals with cheap gas and well-paying jobs in his criminal organization. Eventually, he branched out into other areas like farming, construction and taxis, all while continuing to build his oil theft empire to become known as Mexico’s “King of Gasoline.”
SEE ALSO:
Cartel Takedown Won’t Solve Mexico’s Oil Theft Problem
The fact that Pavón ran his empire from Puebla is no surprise – the state has long been an
epicenter
of the illegal gas trade. Dozens of pipelines carrying fuel from the Gulf of Mexico intersect in a region in the center of the state known as the “
Red Triangle
” before branching off and continuing towards Mexico City and other areas. But while fuel theft has long been a problem in the state, the number of illegal taps has skyrocketed in recent years, increasing
nearly 5,000
percent since 2010, according to Pemex data.
Increasing oil theft has been linked with
spiraling violence
, particularly in Guanajuato which became the deadliest state in Mexico in 2019, in large part due to violence related to oil theft, InSight Crime
reported
. But the daytime murder of Pavón is another reminder of how Puebla has become a
battleground
between rival groups fighting to control this lucrative economy.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made oil theft a
major security priority
for his administration, rallying against both the thieves themselves as well as corrupt Pemex officials. Nevertheless, his strategy of deploying the military to guard refineries, cracking down on criminal groups and
transporting
some oil supplies by truck, has seen only limited success. Despite reducing the amount of gasoline stolen, the number of illegal taps on oil pipelines
has slightly increased
.
InSight Crime Analysis
Pavón was part of the old guard of Mexican huachicoleros (oil thieves), his reputation as a benevolent folk hero a throwback to a bygone era when stolen fuel was a less violent, less contested criminal economy.
When oil theft first emerged as a sustained practice in the 1990s, oil thieves or “huachicoleros” operated on a small scale and generally eschewed violence, often preferring instead to earn the goodwill of locals through handouts of gasoline or sponsoring town festivals, Rolling Stone
reported
. Such thieves have been the subject of
songs
, and even have an informal
patron saint
, “El Niño Huachicolero” (The Boy Oil Thief) – a figure of the infant Jesus holding a jerry can and hose.
El Niño Huachicolero, the unofficial patron saint of oil thieves
However, with the entry of larger cartels, oil theft became far more violent. In
2010
, the Zetas became the first cartel to muscle in on huachicol. Using military-style equipment and tactics, the group added oil theft to their criminal portfolio which already included extortion, kidnapping, arms trafficking and drugs.
Oil theft became a multi-billion dollar trade, reaching an
estimated
$3.25 billion in 2018, before President López Obrador’s reforms. One Zetas sicario even went as far as declaring that illegal gasoline was “approximately as profitable as drugs,” in a
Rolling Stone investigation
.
SEE ALSO:
Stopping Oil Theft in Mexico Futile Game of Whac-a-Mole
Today, the two groups most known for oil theft are the
Jalisco Cartel New Generation
(Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG), one of the country’s two largest criminal groups, and the
Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel
, which specializes in illegal gasoline but is mostly confined in Guanajuato. The two groups have contributed to an
explosion of violence
in Central Mexico, with
massacres
and
targeted assassinations
alike. It is likely that Pavón was one of the many victims of this conflict.
In Puebla, the CJNG is reportedly fighting a remnant of the now-defunct Zetas, known as the Old School Zetas (Zetas Vieja Escuela), for control of the oil trade, according to a December 2019
report
by the United States Congressional Research Service.
After Pavón’s death, it is unlikely that another King of Gasoline will emerge to claim the throne; the context that propelled him to the top of the fuel game has simply changed too much. Facing an uncertain government crackdown, it is far more likely that the remaining scraps of his huachicol empire will be fought over by neighboring cartels, fanning the flames of conflict even further.

Max Radwin,"Twelve companies can now produce medical cannabis in Paraguay.
SHARE
Paraguay issued its first-ever medical cannabis licenses this February, marking a major shift for the marijuana-producing country while raising questions about its approach to fighting illegal cultivation.
Twelve
pharmaceutical companies
received
licenses to
import
seeds for the domestic cultivation and sale of cannabis products with medical benefits, which eligible patients will be able to
obtain
for free.
“We’re talking about so many families that suffer from delicate sicknesses,” Victor Ríos, the senator who sponsored the bill, told InSight Crime. “And many of the people suffering are children. They didn’t have a way of accessing medication.”
Paraguay is the top producer of illegal marijuana in the region. Between 5,000 and 8,000 hectares are cultivated in the country, the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Secretaría Nacional Antidrogas — SENAD) told InSight Crime. Paraguay also happens to be one of the most unequal countries in the world, with nearly
40 percent
of its population living in poverty.
Most illegal plantations
belong
to poor farmers, SENAD officials said, and many of them are looking to complement soy bean and corn yields, two of Paraguay’s
top
exports. And with less than
one percent
of the population consuming marijuana, around 77 percent
ends up
in Brazil. Another 20 percent crosses the country’s southern border into Argentina.
SEE ALSO:
Deadly Riot Shows Paraguay Prisons Unprepared for PCC Onslaught
SENAD focuses much of its
efforts
on crop eradication, which involve aerial monitoring and raids on plantations and packaging outfits. In 2017, Paraguay topped the
list
of countries for the largest number of eradicated cannabis plants. For last year, it
reported
the eradication of over 1,300 hectares just through September.
In the two years, it has taken to prepare Paraguay for the arrival of a functioning medical cannabis industry, SENAD has also developed other strategies for combatting illegal marijuana, some of which focus more on public health and economic assistance.
“Within alternative development programs,” a SENAD spokesperson told InSight Crime, “we believe that medical cannabis can be a pillar. Obviously we aren’t talking about traditional production, but rather controlled production with special regulations.”
InSight Crime Analysis
This first batch of medical cannabis licenses suggests that the Paraguayan government is shifting from a purely criminal understanding of marijuana to one of public health—but questions remain about the approach it is taking.
By granting all of the medical cannabis licenses to well-established pharmaceutical companies instead of poor farmers that grow illegal marijuana, the government has missed an opportunity to solve two problems at once.
Farmers could have benefited financially from a burgeoning medical cannabis industry, and the government could have benefited from integrating those farmers into a legal regulatory system that, in theory, would cut costs devoted to destroying their plantations.

“What happened is the government saw it is as a business opportunity for its friends. The focus is supposed to be public health. A humanitarian focus,” Ríos told InSightCrime. He added, “There is practically no point of connection between what the government does and the bill we are promoting in congress.”
Paraguay is a late mover in the region in allowing some form of legal cultivation of marijuana.
Argentina
,
Brazil
,
Chile and
Peru
permit various levels of medical marijuana use while Uruguay has completely
legalized
its recreational use.
Regional pressure to deal with the marijuana problem appears to have mounted on Paraguay of late, in part because of last year’s high-profile
Itatí trial
. Over thirty people were implicated in a trafficking ring through Argentina, which highlighted the fact that Paraguay continues to supply a majority of its neighbors’ marijuana.

James Bargent,"The largest cocaine seizure in Costa Rica's history
SHARE
The container of ornamental plants had passed through customs at Costa Rica’s port of Limón and was awaiting transfer to a ship headed to the Netherlands. But something about the shipment persuaded anti-narcotics agents to take one last look.
Their hunch was correct. Inside was over five tons of cocaine — the biggest drug haul in Costa Rican history.
The
February 15 seizure
of a drug shipment that would have fetched nearly
$140 million
at wholesale prices at its destination was
celebrated
as testimony to the strides Costa Rica has taken to improve its drug interdiction capacity.
However, this success may prove to be little more than a silver lining to the dark cloud now hovering over the country. The seizure confirmed what has been increasingly evident in recent years: Costa Rica is now a major exporter of cocaine to Europe — and the shipments it sends are being handled by ever more sophisticated national networks.
“On one hand we are happy, but on the other it is worrying because this network was moving very large quantities of drugs,” Juan José Arevalo, head of Costa Rica’s Drug Control Police (Policía Control de Drogas — PCD), told InSight Crime.
SEE ALSO:
Costa Rica’s Port of Limón Feeds European Cocaine Pipeline
Costa Rican authorities have yet to trace the whole journey of the five tons through the country. However, the drugs almost certainly entered through one of four main routes used by traffickers: the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, the port of Limón or the land border with Panama.
Most cocaine enters the country on go-fast boats, semi-submersibles and the stripped out and covered up boats known as low-profile vessels dispatched from Colombia, according to InSight Crime interviews with authorities. The majority of these shipments arrive to the
smugglers’ paradise
of the south
Pacific Ossa peninsula
with its isolated beaches and coves. Some others are received on the Atlantic coast, where small narco-docks and stash houses line the banks of waterways in the wilds of the northern coastline or around the city of Limón.
Authorities have also discovered cocaine entering via the
port of Limón
, hidden in loads or packed into the structures of containers departing from the Colombian
port of Turbo
, while a small percentage arrives by land, crossing the Panama border in modified vehicles with secret compartments.
The trail of the five-ton shipment picks up in San Carlos, a major agricultural zone in the northeast of the country that has become the cornerstone of trafficking to Europe. San Carlos produces most of the fruit, vegetables and ornamental plants that are exported from Costa Rica — the same products sought out by traffickers to conceal cocaine shipments.
In the past, authorities
have uncovered farms and packing companies
in San Carlos that act as fronts, set up or bought out by drug traffickers looking to hide cocaine in apparently legitimate shipments of pineapple, cassava and other products. However, in this case, the evidence points to a different technique: contamination en route between San Carlos and Limón.
“[The drugs] came without any type of protection, there were the packets and beneath them the pots with plants and soil,” said Álvaro González, the head of the Limón branch of Costa Rica’s investigative police, the Judicial Investigation Body (Organismo de Investigación Judicial — OIJ). “This means that the driver left with the plants and at some point en route to the port, he stopped to load the drugs.”
To pack the drugs into the plant shipment, traffickers had to break the customs seal on the container and replace it with a replica — a process that requires corrupt contacts from within the transport companies, the port concession, or customs officials to pass them information about container movements and seal numbers.
“They clone the seals,” said González. “When they break the originals to load the bags, it’s because they have the information to replace it with another one that is the same.”
While authorities have investigated transport companies they suspect of being trafficking fronts, in most cases traffickers need only to pay off the drivers, many of whom are freelancers that the freight companies hire ad hoc to fill orders.
Containers then enter the port district, where there is a
single scanner
to monitor a daily flow of thousands of containers, which is operated not by police or customs but by employees of the port concession holder, APM Terminals.
In the case of the five tons, this critical stage passed without a hitch for the traffickers, and the container was waved through without scanning. It was only the expertise of the PCD agents that then prevented it from shipping out.
“In this case, it was a result of profiling,” said Gonzalez. The type of shipment and movements of the containers raised alerts with the PCD officials, who then inspected the exterior of the container.
The agents noticed an irregularity on the customs seal that was enough to persuade them to send the shipment back to the scanner. The x-ray image then produced left no room for doubt:
202 dark blobs
that had no reason to be in a shipment of plants.
InSight Crime Analysis
The most pressing question now facing Costa Rican authorities is not how the five tons were trafficked, but who was trafficking them. Investigations are ongoing, but one thing is certain — this was a sophisticated network trusted by Colombian traffickers to handle enormous quantities of product.
Costa Rica’s first trafficking networks arose
three decades ago
, when drug routes to the United States shifted from the Caribbean to
Central America and Mexico
. Their main task was to refuel drug boats making their way north from Colombia. Cocaine shipments soon began landing in Costa Rica itself, with local networks tasked with receiving, storing and organizing their transport north by land, sea or air.
Today, there are numerous trafficking cells dedicated to these same tasks. In the Pacific, security sources describe how
experienced smuggling networks
are charged with receiving shipments at sea, bringing them ashore and then delivering them to the warehouses, ranches and houses around the country that are used as stash sites. In the
Atlantic region
, criminal bands maintain docks, safe houses and vehicles used to receive, store and move both cocaine and marijuana imported for the national market.
“These networks are very organized, they have been acquiring properties near to the rivers and close to the coast, which facilitates the entry of the boats that bring the drugs,” said Manuel Jiménez, a prosecutor in Limón.
The task of organizing shipments then falls to different networks, which maintain the corrupt contacts and logistical capacity to contaminate containers.
“This requires different logistics because you need people with more specialized knowledge in issues of exports, customs, freight and shipping companies and even people within the port to gain access to information about which container is heading to which destination,” said Jiménez.
Should traffickers also require armed services, such as security for shipments or murder or kidnapping to collect on debts or settle scores, they can turn to
local gangs
whose core business is controlling national drug markets.
“These bands are closely connected to the issue of assassinations, which are usually related to problems with rival bands over the local drug market, but also for international clients,” Jiménez added.
The key evolution in recent years is who contracts and organizes these networks. In the past, this was the work of agents sent by the Colombian or Mexican owners of the shipments. However, while this is still sometimes the case, a growing percentage of shipments are handled by Costa Rican cocaine brokers.
For exports to Europe, these trafficking coordinators act as the point of contact with the Colombian owners of the shipments. They use their contacts and infrastructure to piece together a supply chain from entry to export in Costa Rica, contracting different cells to receive, store, transport and export the drugs.
Investigators that spoke to InSight Crime describe how these brokers maintain a low profile, moving freely within the legal world behind a façade of being businessmen or even lawyers.
“Today, the drug traffickers are not guys with two machine guns, four gold chains and a fancy car. The profile is different now — they are businessmen with front companies,” said Jimenez.
SEE ALSO:
Costa Rica News and Profile
While Costa Rican authorities have taken down numerous mid-level gangs and transport networks, these more important figures have so far been untouchable.
“Local capos have fallen, little narcos that dominate certain territories and sometimes fight over them, who also might provide services for much bigger organizations,” said Mauricio Boraschi, a former national head of intelligence services and anti-drugs commissioner, who now works as a prosecutor in San José. “But if you ask me if any actual capos have fallen, then the answer is no.”
This failure to reach the top levels of the cocaine trade could prove costly, as it suggests Costa Rican drug trafficking is evolving more rapidly than the state’s response.
“What we see today is a weakening of the Costa Rican state in the face of these structures, and an advance in drug trafficking networks,” said Boraschi.
Whichever network lost the five-ton shipment will now likely be paying a high price. But with
cocaine supply in Colombia
and
demand in Europe
both booming, it is likely to make little difference to Costa Rica’s newfound place in the big leagues of transatlantic cocaine exporters.
“In Costa Rica, we are facing a tsunami of cocaine, and it is drowning us,” concluded Boraschi.

Parker Asmann,"Former Honduras first lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo walks free
SHARE
The Supreme Court of Honduras has thrown out an historic anti-corruption conviction against a former first lady, laying bare the uphill battle the country faces after the dismantling of its internationally-backed anti-graft body.
The announcement that fraud and embezzlement charges against former first lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo would be dropped
came on March 13
, when the Supreme Court also ordered that a new trial be held.
The wife of disgraced former President Porfirio Lobo, Bonilla de Lobo was first
arrested in February 2018
in the capital Tegucigalpa before being
convicted in August 2019
in connection to the “first lady’s petty cash” (Caja Chica de la Primera Dama) case.
SEE ALSO:
Honduras News and Profiles
The investigation carried out by the National Anti-Corruption Council (Consejo Nacional Anticorrupción – CNA) with assistance from the Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Misión de Apoyo contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad en Honduras – MACCIH) and an anti-corruption unit of the Attorney General’s Office known as UFECIC (Unidad Fiscal Especial Contra la Impunidad de la Corrupción – UFECIC)
accused the former first lady
and others of diverting around 16 million lempiras (around $650,000) and creating a money laundering network to cover up stolen government funds meant for social projects.
The conviction marked a historic point for the anti-corruption body MACCIH, which was created in 2015 with the backing of the Organization of American States (OAS) before President Juan Orlando Hernández
refused to extend its mandate
in January 2020. The Honduran Congress, which is controlled by the ruling National Party, had also
voiced its support
for the decision.
InSight Crime Analysis
The conviction of former first lady Bonilla was arguably the most emblematic conviction that MACCIH secured before being shut down in Honduras. Its reversal should serve as a real warning sign.
The MACCIH faced its
fair share of obstacles
from the start, but the anti-corruption body played an important role in combating corruption in a country that has become accustomed to business and political elites pilfering state institutions and stealing public funds.
One high-profile investigation dubbed the
Pandora Case
, for example, singled out dozens of officials from both the National and Liberal parties for diverting some $12 million from the Honduran treasury. Some of this cash stolen from government coffers
went directly to
funding efforts for President Hernández’s first successful bid for the presidency in 2013.
SEE ALSO:
Honduras Anti-Corruption Probe Implicates President, Opposition
In its four years in operation, MACCIH members helped prosecute 133 people and investigate 14 cases, according to
information from the OAS
. President Hernández has said his government
remains committed
to combating corruption, but Bonilla de Lobo’s release and his own refusal to put any meaningful support behind the MACCIH’s renewal or broader anti-graft measures suggests otherwise.
The creation of the MACCIH was a much-needed step towards moving away from corruption as the “
operating system
” in Honduras, but the smirk on Bonilla de Lobo’s face as she left jail earlier this month makes clear the
elites have fired back

For the first time, the International Narcotics Control Board has recognized the growing influence of the “Cartel of the Suns,” the name for a criminal structure within the ranks of the Venezuelan government and military, in the country’s drug trafficking.
In its
2019 report,
the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) reports uncovering evidence about a network of members of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana – FANB) and other groups within the Venezuelan government dedicated to facilitating the transport of drugs in and out of the country.
“There are indications that in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, criminal groups have succeeded in infiltrating government security forces, forming an informal network known as the ‘Cartel of the Suns’ to facilitate the passage of illicit drugs into and out the country
,” indicated the report published on February 27, 2020.
According to investigations
by InSight Crime
, the Cartel of the Suns, known in Spanish as the ‘
Cartel de los Soles,’
consists of a series of cells made up of high-ranking members of the FANB and government officials involved in drug trafficking-related activities.

Venezuela News and Profile
The Cartel of the Suns, a name alluding to the stars Venezuelan generals wear on their uniforms, started out accepting bribes in exchange for looking the other way when drugs passed and protecting Colombian drug traffickers operating from Venezuela. However, over the last decade, they have grown stronger and have
acquired
a greater share in drug trafficking.
Furthermore, the INCB report describes Venezuela as the main bridge to the United States and Europe used by criminal groups to transport large quantities of Colombian-produced cocaine. Additionally, it explains that aircrafts loaded with drug shipments regularly take off from Venezuela en route to Guatemala and Honduras.
The document indicates that Colombian traffickers are looking to move cocaine base paste to Venezuela for processing, where 22 medium-sized cocaine laboratories located in the border region were destroyed in 2018.
The report also highlights the 35.5 tons of cocaine hydrochloride reportedly seized by Venezuelan authorities in 2018, making it the country with the second-highest number of seizures after Colombia.
InSight Crime Analysis
While the participation of Venezuelan military officials in drug trafficking has been going on since the 1990s, the recent acknowledgment of the Cartel of the Suns’ existence is yet more confirmation of its growing importance in the international drug trafficking scenario.
Former Venezuelan judge
Mildred Camero considers the announcement to be a positive step but states that “the international community has taken a long time to recognize what is happening in Venezuela, primarily in relation to drug trafficking and the involvement of a significant part of the armed forces. As of 2003, we began to point out the incursion of the Venezuelan military in drug trafficking in the annual reports we sent to the INCB,” the expert told InSight Crime.
The United States has also warned of the links between criminal operations and the Venezuelan military. In 2010, Washington issued sanctions against the former director of the defunct Venezuelan intelligence agency, who now serves as the governor of Trujillo, General
Henry Rangel Silva
, for drug trafficking, as well as against the former interior minister,
Ramón Rodríguez Chacín
, and former intelligence chief,
Hugo Carvajal
.
In 2016, former GNB comandante and current Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace,
Néstor Reverol
, was accused by a New York court of accepting bribes to allow cocaine trafficking while he led Venezuela’s anti-narcotics agency.
In 2018, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) sanctioned
Diosdado Cabello
for “drug trafficking, money laundering and other corrupt activities.” Cabello is considered to be one of the key figures within the Cartel of the Suns as well as holding broad power having previously been vice president and Speaker of the National Assembly. A recent article by
ABC reported
that he leads the network of FANB officials that work to control gold, fuel and drug contraband.
The Cartel of the Suns is not only made up of military officers. High-ranking government officials have also been indicated as participating in drug trafficking operations, among them Vice President
Tareck El Aissami
.

Venezuela: A Mafia State?
The Venezuelan military takes action as needed to ensure the covert entrance and exit of the aircrafts transporting the drug shipments. One popular way to achieve this is to
switch off aerial radars
precisely when aircrafts enter or leave, as a GNB colonel in Zulia state reportedly did for a drug trafficking network operating between Colombia, Venezuela, Central America and Mexico.
Another practice recently detected
is the sale of air entrance codes,
a practice employed by Gino Vergara, an airforce captain who made up part of an organization linked to Mexican and Colombian cartels, according to an investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

Angela Olaya and Josefina Salomón,"InSight Crime's conference in Buenos Aires discussed how the PCC was able to grow so rapidly in Brazil and Paraguay
SHARE
Thanks to a combination of great organizational capacity, control of prisons, high levels of loyalty among its members and dominance of key criminal economies, the PCC has become one of the most powerful criminal structures in South America.
But the question a panel of experts in crime and security sought to answer at an InSight Crime conference in Buenos Aires on March 5 was: how far can they go?
Born in the prisons of the Brazilian state of São Paulo in the 1990s, it is estimated that the
First Capital Command
(Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC) today has at least 30,000 members throughout the country.
“The PCC is unlike any other (criminal) organization in its structure, hierarchy, logistics within prisons and ability to regulate criminal markets,” said Matthew Taylor, associate professor and Brazil expert at American University in Washington D.C.
The group has thrived within Brazil’s criminal context, allowing it to recruit almost at will from overcrowded prisoners, offering its members a measure of protection from violence and a sense of belonging as well as providing them with services. This access to thousands of current and former inmates has been key to the group’s expansion across much of Brazil, as well as in
neighboring
Paraguay.
SEE ALSO:
PCC News and Profile
By 2016, the PCC had replicated its prison control model in six Brazilian states, according to Bruno Paes Manso, a journalist and researcher at the University of São Paulo. He told the conference that another great advantage of the PCC is to be an arbiter of violence.
In areas under their control, be it prisons or entire neighborhoods, “you cannot kill without the authorization of the group,” explained Paes Manso.
Juan Alberto Martens Molas, a professor of criminology at Paraguay’s National University of Pilar in Paraguay, also explained that institutional and security problems in Paraguay had opened the door to the PCC’s expansion and consolidation there.
As he pointed out, Paraguay’s illegal economy corresponds to about 39 percent of the country’s legitimate GDP, especially through lucrative criminal economies such as smuggling, arms trafficking and drug trafficking. Coupled with a weak response from authorities and a soaring prison population, the country has become an ideal breeding ground for the PCC.
InSight Crime’s co-director, Steven Dudley, described the PCC as “a very eclectic criminal group” before mentioning several points which has made Paraguay ideal for the PCC’s expansion. Firstly, the country has a history of criminal groups accumulating power, acting as companies and even leading to entire political structures being based around criminal economies, especially the cultivation and production of marijuana or cigarette smuggling.
Secondly, there is real institutional weakness due to the involvement of politicians and authorities in criminal economies. These ties mean that elected officials have no interest in strengthening judicial systems, prisons, or the police, the very institutions needed to fight the PCC, instead leaving them intentionally weakened.
And thirdly, the state of Paraguay’s prisons means that they are fertile ground for the PCC, whose recruitment is anchored by its presence in prisons. “Paraguay has turned to mass incarceration, with a prison population which leapt from around 3,000 in 2000 to around 13,000 in 2019,” explained Dudley.
Another question raised at the debate is whether the PCC could now expand further, specifically into Argentina. Being a
top cocaine consumer
, Argentina would seem to be a prime target for the PCC.
Carolina Sampó, coordinator for the Center for Transnational Organized
Crime
(Centro de Estudios Sobre Crimen Organizado Transnacional — CeCOT) at the University of La Plata, Argentina, told the conference that the PCC is unlikely to see Argentina as its next frontier.
“Argentina has a very high rate of drug use but this does not mean that it is an interesting country for international criminal organizations because it is still a relatively small market,” said Sampó.
She added that its criminal context is quite different to its neighbors since drug trafficking is dominated by clans focused on local distribution and not on international trafficking. There have been exceptions such as the Loza and Castedo clans, according to Sampó, who had international distribution routes but microtrafficking for domestic consumption remains the norm.
“There are several elements inhibiting the PCC from coming to Argentina: the country is not a drug producer, the state has more control over prisons than in other countries and this is reflected in the levels of violence on the streets.”

Chris Dalby,"Increased security of containers entering the port of Antwerp has helped authorities catch tons of cocaine each year
SHARE
In recent years, the port of Antwerp in Belgium has been the main entry point for cocaine into Europe, and authorities are actively trying to change that fact. But what can really be done besides continually increasing seizures of cocaine?
In early January, the Belgian government announced that 61.8 metric tons of cocaine had been seized at the port in 2019, alongside 1.87 metric tons of heroin and 504 kilograms of marijuana. This marked a 23 percent rise from 2018 for cocaine, and an increase of 660 percent over the last five years, news site HLN
reported
citing government data.
This staggering increase has been attributed to the
launch
in February 2018 of the
Stroomplan
(Flow Plan), which brings together local and federal police, customs, prosecutors, port authorities and city officials in Antwerp.
SEE ALSO:
Coverage of European Organized Crime
When it began, the Stroomplan was given a team of 30 to 40 officers, with plans to double it over time. The squad was named Kali, for a Hindu goddess who fights evil spirits and as a nod to the Colombian city of Cali, Belgian news site VRT
reported
.
“Fortunately we are still light-years away in Antwerp [from being like Cali],” Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever
told
VRT. “But the increasing cash volume of drug gangs means that they can disrupt the city and society.”
The beefing up of port security structure is also being replicated in Latin America, where the United Nations’
Container Control Programme
(CCP) places staff and trains officials to help with container inspections.
CCP director Bob van den Berghe told InSight Crime that Antwerp’s dominance as a port of entry for cocaine is clear. “Of the 77 tons of cocaine that were seized by the CCP in 2019, 63 tons were seized in Latin America, and of those, 31 tons were bound for Antwerp,” he said.
According to van den Berghe, 24.5 tons of cocaine were seized in Brazil’s main port of Santos during 47 seizures in 2019. Fourteen tons of cocaine were seized in Colombia, and around 7.5 tons each in Ecuador, Panama and Peru.
The variety of smuggling methods also requires constant scrutiny. Recent photos released by Belgian customs at Antwerp
showed
drugs being stashed in jewelry, chocolates, packs of coffee and bottles of wine.
InSight Crime Analysis
While seizures of cocaine at the port of Antwerp have climbed rapidly, similar scenarios have been playing out around the world, including in the
United States
and
Brazil
. This makes it difficult to know whether the seizures are due to increased port security and intelligence or simply the fact that cocaine is
being produced
at historic levels.
A recent
study
of the effectiveness of the Stroomplan, published in February 2020 by the University of Ghent in Belgium, found that the Kali team was facing major difficulties  carrying out its duties. These included not having access to federal databases to check relevant data, the port of Antwerp being located across two judicial districts, a lack of investigative capacity and a lack of support at the federal level. The study recommended the creation of a national-level plan to reduce some of these hurdles.

:
Cocaine Hidden in Fruit Feeds European Pipeline
A national focus would seem to make sense, as Antwerp is also not the only port Belgium now has to worry about. In December, controls were increased at the port of Zeebrugge after 855 kilograms of cocaine were found in Suriname bound for Belgium’s second port,
reported
the Brussels Times. Some 1.5 metric tons of cocaine were also found
stashed
in a cargo of fruit juice at the smaller port of Ghent.
In a statement sent to InSight Crime, the port of Antwerp emphasized that drug control was a common responsibility, adding that the port was taking steps to improve. “We are going to ensure that every terminal has its own security: that means proper supervision and registration policy. Every company in the port must know and be able to report who goes in and out,” the officials wrote in a statement.
And while Bob van den Berghe was generally positive about the port of Antwerp’s efforts, as evidenced by its high seizures, he identified certain vulnerabilities. “The port of Antwerp is an open port as opposed to Rotterdam, which is a closed port,” van den Berghe told InSight Crime. “Containers can be scanned at the container terminal in Rotterdam, but in Antwerp, they have to leave the terminal to be scanned, which is a vulnerability.”
At the moment, it appears more progress is being made across the Atlantic. While drug traffickers have been diversifying the exit points for drugs from Latin America, the UN’s CCP has
also been busy
collaborating with more ports, which has likely contributed to more seizures from
gigantic mega-ports
in Brazil to
smaller regional facilities
in Costa Rica.

Can Port of Antwerp Truly Stem Cocaine Entering Europe?

Venezuela Investigation Unit,"The criminal groups operating on the border between Arauca (Colombia) and Apure (Venezuela) have found 
 a new business: smuggling Venezuelan cheese
SHARE
Cheese has increasingly joined oil and other commodities smuggled along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, and criminal groups are milking the profits.
Groups operating in the state of Apure, located in northwestern Venezuela, have found that the dairy product more than doubles in value after crossing the Arauca river and reaching Bogotá.
Traditional white farmer’s cheese is ubiquitous at restaurants in Colombia and served with nearly all local dishes. In Arauca,
informal merchants also sell the Venezuelan cheeses in the streets and at local shops.
Seizures of Venezuelan cheese
in Colombia are becoming so frequent that Julián García, the chief of the Intelligence Section of the Colombian Police (Seccional de Inteligencia de la Policía de Colombia – SIPOL) in Arauca, compared Venezuelan cheese smuggling with the
long-time and lucrative gasoline and diesel fuel smuggling business
in the border area.
“In comparison with
la Guajira
or with Cúcuta, gasoline smuggling instances are very low here. The strong business here is cheese and meat smuggling,” he told InSight Crime.
A kilo of cheese is worth about 9,000 pesos (just under $3) in Arauca, whereas in Bogotá it is worth more than 22,000 pesos (about $6).
“The business lies in bringing the cheese from Venezuela to Bogota,” he said.
SEE ALSO:
Venezuela Govt. Controls Spur Cattle Smuggling Into Colombia
The price difference has led to massive amounts of contraband cheese being moved across this border. In just two operations that took place within the last quarter of 2019, Colombian authorities seized
more than a ton and a half of Venezuelan cheese
.
The cheese
had entered via boat
through the Arauca River.
In December 2018, Colombian authorities
dismantled a criminal organization in Arauca known as “Los Suizos” that had
smuggled about 100 tons
of cheese across the border.
Armed groups, including Colombia’s National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC),”make up part of the chain controlling this activity,” García said.
InSight Crime Analysis
Essential goods will naturally be smuggled along the Venezuela-Colombia border. Illegal transport has become a survival mechanism for Venezuelans hard hit by their country’s humanitarian crisis and provides illicit cash to criminal groups operating on both sides of the Arauca river.
During a visit to the border area, an InSight Crime team learned how large quantities of gasoline, diesel, scrap metal, meat, livestock and cheese cross the border daily via 22 crossings located along the 300 kilometers of river between Apure and Arauca.
Although cheese contraband is not new, it has intensified as Venezuela’s currency has crashed.
“The smugglers buy the cheese from agricultural producers at a
wholesale price
of about 160,000 bolívares (less than $3), much lower than the price in Colombia. They then pay the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana – GNB) so that they allow them to cross the border with the merchandise and they sell the cheese on the Colombian side for up to three times what they paid in Venezuela (more than $6), as if it were Colombian cheese,” a rancher from the state of Apure told InSight Crime, who asked that his identity not be revealed.
SEE ALSO:
Venezuela News and Profiles
Additionally, the mass arrival of
more than 1.5 million Venezuelans to Colombia
would also influence the increase in demand (previously non-existent) of typical products from Venezuela, such as the fresh cheeses. This growing market could be a stimulus for contraband organizations.“Those that buy (the most cheese), are Venezuelans here in Colombia,” according to García, the chief of SIPOL in Arauca. He said he believes the “cheese [business] could be more profitable (than gas).”
In Central America, several large drug trafficking groups started as dairy smugglers, particularly in western Honduras and eastern El Salvador. The Salvadoran group known as
Los Perrones
opened routes and established political contacts in order to guarantee the  cheese contraband smuggled in from Nicaragua. Later, they would use those same routes and contacts to enter into the cocaine trafficking business.
In the case of the smuggled Venezuelan cheese, the big winner at the moment is the ELN, which taxes all contraband from Venezuela to Colombia. “The ELN controls the River (Arauca),” García said.
One resident of Apure, who admitted to working as a contraband smuggler, put it simply: “At the end of the day, we all work for the guerrillas.”

Chris Dalby,"A post on Twitter falsely claims that cocaine can kill the coronavirus
SHARE
A social media post claiming falsely that cocaine can cure COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus, has been shared thousands of times on Twitter in recent weeks.
Thankfully, the majority of those sharing it seemed to treat it as a joke.
First shared by Twitter user Bizzle Osikoya, who is based in Nigeria, on February 3, the post has since been shared over 2,700 times on Twitter, with reactions ranging from humor to disbelief.
pic.twitter.com/stjYcihGiz
— Bizzle Osikoya (@bizzleosikoya)
February 3, 2020
While it is uncertain if anybody has used cocaine to try and prevent coronavirus, the rumor spread like wildfire and authorities have responded.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has
posted
on its website, denying that cocaine can protect against the coronavirus. “Cocaine is a stimulating and addictive drug. Its consumption causes serious side effects and is detrimental to people’s health,” it wrote.
The global health body has also denied
numerous
other false rumors about the disease, including that it can be transmitted through mosquito bites, can be treated by spraying chlorine on one’s body, by wearing sesame oil, or by washing one’s hands with the urine of children.
And although this fake news originated in Nigeria, it has been seized upon by Latin American media outlets, such as Argentina’s
Telam,
Mexico’s
La Vanguardia
and Brazil’s
UOL
, which have all devoted articles to debunking the rumor.
InSight Crime Analysis
Even if cocaine did somehow kill the coronavirus, it would not be a huge help in Latin America, where only three confirmed cases had been confirmed by February 28. The
first
is a Brazilian man living in São Paulo who had recently traveled to Italy, the
second
is a Mexican citizen in Mexico City who had also recently been in Italy, and the third is a 41-year-old Mexican citizen in the
Pacific state of Sinaloa
.
Should any Brazilian Twitter users have believed the fake news post, some could probably afford to indulge their gullibility since one gram of poor quality cocaine base costs around $5 on average, Deutsche Welle
reported
, quoting figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
In Mexico, the price can climb a little higher. A 2017 investigation by
Radio Formula
in Mexico City found one gram of cocaine being sold at 350 pesos (around $18) and one gram of crack costing 250 pesos (around $12.50).
But this is far from the first time cocaine has been used medicinally. After the cocaine alkaloid was first
discovered
in 1855 by German chemist Friedrich Gaedcke, it became highly popular in Victorian Britain. It was alleged to help with
everything
from flatulence and whitening of the teeth to dandruff. It was even
marketed
as cough drops for children.
Today, it is still
used
in some forms as an anesthetic to numb the mouth and lining of the throat.

Laura Marcela Zuñiga ,"Members of the PGC captured in Paraguay
SHARE
Two recent events show how one of Brazil’s regional gangs, the PGC, is making waves inside Paraguay, likely seeking to emulate the drug trafficking success that its larger rivals have found there.
On February 5, Paraguayan authorities
captured
Guillerme Antonio Vieira, alias “Xiru,” the supposed leader of the Brazilian group Primeiro Grupo Catarinense (PGC) in Paraguay’s border city of Capitán Bado.
As the regional PGC chief in Paraguay, Vieira was responsible for sending monthly shipments of cocaine and weapons to the group’s headquarters, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, who in turn distributed the drugs in Brazil and abroad,
ABC Color
reported
.

:
Brazil News and Profile
This is not the first time that the PGC has been found to have a connection to Paraguay. In January 2019, five members were
captured
on a highway close to Ciudad del Este, in the border area between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, according to a
statement
by Paraguay’s national police
While not a national criminal threat on the scale of the First Capital Command
(Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC
) and Comando Vermelho
(Red Command – CV)
, the PGC has largely uncontested control over the southern state of Santa Catarina and its capital city of Florianópolis, a port and strategic corridor for trafficking drugs abroad.
In 2014, a report by Peru’s Counternarcotics Directorate (Dirreción Nacional Antidrogas – DIRANDRO) stated that this group may have been responsible for up to 60 percent of the cocaine
trafficked
out of the country.
InSight Crime Analysis
Paraguay has until now been reported to largely be a playground of the PCC, Brazil’s largest criminal group, which is taking over the country’s
prison system
and
feuding
with local gangs. But this shows that Brazil’s smaller gangs also want a share of the pie.
Following in the wake of the PCC and CV which have converted
border cities like Pedro Juan Caballero into permanent operation centers, from where they
control
the trafficking of drugs and arms into Brazil, may actually have made it easier for the PGC to set up shop.

Eimhin O'Reilly,"Fentanyl seizures in Zacatecas confirm that the state has become a major distribution hub.
SHARE
Five gangs are reportedly vying for control of the fentanyl trade in Mexico’s inland state of Zacatecas, suggesting that trafficking of this dangerous opioid is happening more widely across Mexico.
In early February
, Zacatecas’ Secretary of Public Security Ismael Camberos Hernández suggested that 90 percent of homicides in the state could be attributed to conflicts between criminal groups, which have been reportedly engaged in a five-way battle over the fentanyl trade that has intensified in the last year.
According to
data
from the National Public Security System (Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública – SNSP), the number of homicides recorded in the state skyrocketed to
666
, over double the
280 homicides
recorded a decade ago.
SEE ALSO:
Fentanyl Enters Heroin Supply in Tijuana, Mexico
How many of these homicides can be directly attributed to the fentanyl trade is a difficult question to answer. Nevertheless,
three important seizures
of the synthetic opioid made on the state’s highways last year suggest that Zacatecas is a significant transit point in the trafficking of the synthetic opioid. In 2018, the state’s Attorney General’s Office also began using
chromatography equipment, devices that can detect and identify samples of fentanyl, to help combat trafficking,
Televisa News
reported.
However, efforts to curb the fentanyl trade in the state are being hampered by a serious lack of police officers. Five municipalities within Zacatecas
have no police presence whatsoever
, creating a security vacuum for illegal actors to exploit.
Insight Crime Analysis
According to a 2019
InSight Crime investigation
, drug trafficking is a major contributor to violence around Mexico’s Pacific ports and the country’s northwestern border with the United States. A
2019 report
also identified 13 routes for fentanyl trafficking, all along Mexico’s Pacific coast.
At first glance, Zacatecas’ inland, central location appears to buck this trend by shifting trafficking routes eastward. However, the state features two major highways including a stretch of the Pan-American Highway, which connects Central America to the US border, and Highway 54, connecting the state of Colima, home to Mexico’s busiest port at Manzanillo, with the US border at Tamaulipas.
At the same time, Zacatecas borders eight other Mexican states, including two on the border with the United States, and the country’s industrial heartland in Guanajuato. Together, this suggests that it central location has made it an important distribution hub in the transit of fentanyl towards the United States.
SEE ALSO:
Mexico News and Profile
The Mexican fentanyl trade is
principally dominated
by two cartels – the
Jalisco Cartel New Generation
(Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG) and the
Sinaloa Cartel
. Both groups have a presence in Zacatecas as part of their larger criminal operations, which include the importation and smuggling of fentanyl across the US border. However, within Zacatecas, they are also
joined by
the
Gulf Cartel
, as well as the
Northeastern Cartel
and the
Talibanes
, both offshoots of the
Zetas
.
Although extremely volatile, this five-way power struggle is not wholly unexpected. Fentanyl can be
50 times more powerful
than heroin, allowing criminal groups to traffic relatively small amounts without requiring the sophisticated production and trafficking networks necessary for the cocaine or heroin trade. While fentanyl has not yet replaced heroin, the expansion of the fentanyl trade into new territory confirms that it has become one of the primary criminal economies in Mexico.
The situation in Zacatecas is therefore not necessarily unique. Indeed, a
fentanyl seizure
made in Chihuahua earlier this year demonstrates that trafficking routes are expanding beyond the coast to affect inland and border states. If other criminal groups muscle in on the fractious fentanyl trade in other key sites, it is likely that the violent dynamic in Zacatecas will continue to repeat itself elsewhere in Mexico.

SHARE
Seizures of synthetic drugs in Chile have skyrocketed from 2,304 doses in 2010 to more than 1.5 million doses in 2019, raising the question of how, or even if, Chilean authorities can cope with this dangerous flow.
In late January, the head of controlled chemical substances at Chile’s investigative police, Patricio Navarro
told
Bio Bio Radio of this “alarming” increase. And though the use of synthetic drugs is on the rise in other Latin American countries, such as
Argentina
and
Costa Rica
, the rate at which Chilean domestic demand is
growing
– a
1,346
percent increase in three years – is far greater.
In June of 2019, customs officials at the Arturo Merino Benitez Airport
seized
9,860 pills of MDMA hidden between the soles of seven pairs of shoes – all belonging to a Spanish citizen. The case was similar to another in February 2019, in which another European passenger was apprehended with 27,122 MDMA pills in the double bottom of his suitcase. Police have responded by increasing monitoring at airports because they believe synthetic drugs primarily enter Chile from Europe and by air,
said La Tercera
quoting police sources.

Chile News and Profile
In fact, the anti-drug unit of the Attorney General’s Office has identified
three
new routes central to ecstasy’s entry into Chile: direct mail from Europe (via the Netherlands or Spain), through packages from Colombia, or hidden inside vehicles that enter Chile through mountain-passes from Argentina.
And synthetic drugs are also being produced locally. Just this past year, InSight Crime
reported
on a lab in the port city of Antofagasta, importing raw material from Brazil to synthesize the hallucinogenic drug DMT, aka the ‘spirit molecule.’ As of October 2018, the Attorney General’s Office had identified 15 drug laboratories, at least
three of which
were used for the production of synthetic drugs.
InSight Crime Analysis
There are several reasons why Chile is becoming a sought-after market for synthetic drug traffickers. Its middle class
accounts
for more than half the population, the average Chilean’s purchasing power is
also growing
, and it
faces
relatively little organized crime of its own. All this, coupled with its geographic location, has made it an ideal and close market for Latin American drug gangs.
The alarming rise in synthetic drug seizures shows the government has not been able to respond rapidly to contain this problem, although this may be changing. In September 2019, Chilean police scored a coup by
taking down
a ring of synthetic drug traffickers alongside their Argentine counterparts, part of a cooperation agreement
signed
almost a year earlier.
In fact, Chile is coordinating with authorities in
many jurisdictions
, including Bolivia, Italy and Spain, as well as
increasing levels
of cooperation and information sharing within its own ranks.

Argentina, Chile Team Up in Battle Against Synthetic Drugs
This approach is wise. Synthetic drug traffickers operate with a different modus operandi than cocaine or heroin dealers. Where the latter move drugs along well-established routes, the global distribution chain for synthetic drugs is varied. Much of the world’s MDMA and ecstasy comes from
the Netherlands
and
Belgium
, and is then
smuggled
into Latin America.
Once here, these drugs can easily be cut, modified or otherwise have their chemical composition altered.
“Pink cocaine”
found in Argentina and Uruguay or ecstasy pills
stamped
in the shape of US President Donald Trump are just some recent examples of the varied forms these drugs can take.

Max Radwin,"Showtime's The Trade come's out March 6.
SHARE
The second season of Showtime’s The Trade comes out March 6, and this time around the award-winning documentary series is doing a deep-dive into the criminal activities surrounding Central American migration to the United States.
The four-part series jumps around to various families facing the different challenges that occur at each step of the migration process, whether that be escaping the violence of the Northern Triangle, walking thousands of miles through Mexico or making a new life in the US.
“I hope people understand a little more about what migrants have to go through,” producer Monica Villamizar told InSight Crime. “There are all these people showing up to the US border and you ask, ‘Why?’ ‘What’s going on?’ This will really tell you in a way that’s never been done before.”
At first, some of the footage might feel similar to the many other migration documentaries and news stories that have come out over the years. The first episode opens on the US-Mexico border wall in dramatic light. Later there’s the out-of-breath border agents chasing down migrants, the tattooed MS13 gang members in handcuffs, and of course, the wide-angle shots of people atop “the beast” train as it pushes through dangerous parts of Mexico.
However, the series quickly pivots to more unique subject matter, placing all of these experiences in the context of organized crime—and with access most documentaries would salivate at.
One of the central figures of this season is Magda. For years, her husband worked as a “trigger man” for MS13 in San Pedro Sula, the
murder capital
of Honduras. When her husband decided to leave the gang and straighten out his life, they killed him and issued near-constant threats against Magda.

Documentary Series Examines Role of Mexico’s Crime Groups in Opioid Crisis
“Justice?” She asks, in reference to her husband’s killer, who everyone in the community knows. “That doesn’t exist here.”
The show follows her on the long, arduous journey to the United States, showing some of the smaller, moment-to-moment challenges that it entails. What roads will best avoid Mexican drug cartels? Where is there access to a doctor? Can the other migrants traveling nearby be trusted?
Much of the series takes place in McAllen, Texas, a popular crossing-point for Central American migrants. Ramirez, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, is looking into a small-scale smuggling operation. He stakes out a “stash house” near the border, where migrants hide out until smugglers can move them to their next destination.
While searching the premises, Ramirez finds condom wrappers strewn about the floor, suggesting that the stash house is being used for sex trafficking. He tracks down the caretaker of the house, and then after some investigation, Gerardo Naranjo-Chavez, alias “Express,” the leader.
But Express is not the only one investigated for human trafficking in this series. Almost every episode makes a point of showing how the vulnerability of migrants can put them at risk of sex work and other forms of exploitation.
Later in the series, a woman named Sochil discusses her childhood experience with Luz del Mundo, a Mexican megachurch whose leaders molested and raped her.
“My aunt made it seem like it was normal,” Sochil says, “that it was a blessing, because they instill it in your brain. They engrave it in your brain.”
The storyline feels a bit extraneous considering that it has little to do with migration, but that can be forgiven considering the gravity of the topic. Luz del Mundo has millions of followers despite the leaders’ numerous charges of extortion, forcible rape of a minor, production of child pornography and human trafficking.
At the very least, the storyline shows how easily vulnerable demographics of Latin America can be coerced into situations of exploitation, many of which go unchecked because the culprits hold positions of power.
InSight Crime Analysis
The series does an excellent job of explaining the various criminal activities that both fuel, and develop out of, the wave of migrants heading toward the United States from Central America.
Its footage of gang violence in Honduras accurately depicts how a lack of economic opportunity in the country continues to drive young men to join gangs like MS13.
“The gang gives them three meals a day,” one pastor in Honduras says. “They provide them love and respect. But once they are inside they realize this is not what they signed up for.”
Magda’s story, the constant fear in which she lived following her husband’s death, may provide some viewers with a deeper understanding of how a person can arrive at the decision to leave home and embark on such a perilous journey.
SEE ALSO:
The US-Mexico Border’s Eastern End: A Forgotten Criminal Enclave?
That journey, the series shows, is much more complex than making it safely from point A to point B. Coyotes charge thousands of dollars so they can bribe law enforcement and cartels, as well as pay truck drivers who in one episode receive $1,000 for every migrant they transport in their trailers. For viewers who only understand migration through annual statistics and hot-button political talking points, these kinds of details may prove revelatory.
The show’s focus on human trafficking specifically, however, may leave the most lasting impact. There are nearly 25 million victims of human trafficking
worldwide
, many of them migrants who will never receive justice, and “The Trade” makes the rare effort of showing just how many different forms the crime can take.
In every storyline, the series highlights the ineffectiveness and, in some cases, unfairness built into the legal systems fighting all of these criminal activities. Whether waiting for the return of a nephew’s body caught in bureaucratic limbo, a man facing deportation due to a tree he cut down in his yard, or officials rescinding police protection for a trafficking victim, the series offers more than enough to leave viewers feeling as frustrated about the situation as they are distraught.

US authorities allege that a recently arrested drug trafficker relied on protection from Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández and his brother Tony to manufacture hundreds of kilograms of cocaine per month, broadening the scope of the narco-politics nexus in the Central American nation.
US authorities arrested Geovanny Daniel Fuentes Ramírez at the international airport in Miami, Florida, on March 1 on drug and weapons charges, the Justice Department announced in a
March 3 press release
.
Prosecutors allege that beginning in 2009, Fuentes Ramírez’s began operating a cocaine laboratory in the coastal town of Omoa in northwest Cortés department along Honduras’ Caribbean coast with the capacity to produce 300 to 500 kilograms of cocaine per month, according to the
criminal complaint
.
Omoa sits in a highly strategic location near Puerto Cortés, one of Honduras’ largest commercial ports. The town is also not far from Puerto Barrios, another large port down the coast to the west in neighboring Guatemala. Both towns are part of a main cocaine trafficking route in the Central American corridor.
SEE ALSO:
Honduras News and Profiles
In order to ensure protection and the safe passage of drug shipments, Fuentes Ramírez allegedly bribed members of the Honduran National Police, as well as high-ranking politicians and members of congress, according to authorities. He is also believed to have reported directly to Tony Hernández, the former congressman and brother of
President Juan Orlando Hernández
who was
convicted on US drug charges
in October 2019.
Fuentes Ramírez and Tony Hernández were drug trafficking associates since at least 2012, according to a Honduran military intelligence official who spoke to InSight Crime on the condition of anonymity.
A retired police chief that investigated drug activity in Honduras in the first half of the last decade told InSight Crime that Fuentes Ramírez also had relationships with several Honduran politicians and officials.
In addition to the drug lab, Fuentes Ramírez also reportedly used a clandestine airstrip near Cortés department to receive and transport shipments of Colombian cocaine, as well as to move drug shipments manufactured inside the lab itself, according to authorities.
For his part, President Hernández called the allegations linking him to Fuentes Ramírez “100 percent false,” adding in a
statement on Twitter
that such claims were “based on the lies of confessed criminals looking for revenge or to reduce their sentences.”
InSight Crime Analysis
The latest criminal complaint in the United States suggests that political powers in Honduras didn’t just turn a blind eye to help facilitate the trafficking of Colombian cocaine shipments through the country and into the United States, but also provided cover for domestic drug production for more than a decade.
In fact, the depth of corruption appears to have reached the top of the Hernández family and the president himself.
Around 2013, Fuentes Ramírez allegedly paid $25,000 to a “high-ranking Honduran official” identified as “CC-4” —
presumably
President Hernández, although he is not directly named — in order to secure protection for the cocaine lab in Omoa, according to the criminal complaint. “CC-4” was reportedly interested in the drug lab due to its “proximity to a major commercial shipping port,” according to US officials.
In return, authorities allege “CC-4” agreed to use Honduras’ armed forces to ensure the security of Fuentes Ramírez’s drug trafficking activities. However, “CC-4” reportedly told Fuentes Ramírez that he would have to report directly to his brother, Tony, who was “managing drug trafficking activities in Honduras,” according to prosecutors.

The Downfall of Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández
This is not the first time that President Hernández’s name has come up in US drug trafficking investigations. As part of the probe into the president’s brother’s drug conspiracy, US authorities alleged that President Hernández — again identified as “CC-4” —
met with former El Paraíso mayor
Amilcar Alexander Ardón Soriano around 2008 to discuss the drug trafficking arrangement he had brokered with Tony.
After then-President Porfirio Lobo won the 2009 election, Ardón and Hernández allegedly met once more, according to prosecutors, to discuss bribes that needed to be paid to other congressmen in order to pave the way for Hernández’s election as president of the legislative body, which would later lead to his ascent to the presidency.
During Tony’s trial, prosecutors alleged President Hernández
accepted millions of dollars in bribes
to fund his successful presidential campaign in 2013, including from the now-jailed former Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo.” The Honduran president has
adamantly rejected
such accusations in the past.
As head of state, President Hernández currently enjoys immunity from US prosecution. However, when he leaves office in 2022, the latest criminal complaint suggests that authorities in the United States may now be laying the groundwork for a potential future criminal prosecution against him.

In a year marked by political and criminal turmoil, Latin American capitals did not escape the effects of the corruption, organized crime and state repression experienced throughout the region.
From the violent clashes between security forces and protests in Nicaragua and Chile, to the splintering of criminal groups in the capitals of Mexico and Colombia, capital cities in the region ranked among the most violent in the world.
In this special report, InSight Crime analyzes the homicide rate of each of Latin America’s capital cities, identifying the factors leading to these rates of violence.
*Correction:
A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that Panama City’s homicide rate was 44 per 100,000 people. This wrong calculation was based on a misunderstanding between figures for Panama City and the larger District of Panama. Our coverage of organized crime relies on thorough checking of facts and figures, especially when making such regional comparisons. Sometimes, we fall short. We regret the error.

Caracas, Venezuela: 76 per 100,000
In the midst of the economic, political and social crisis faced by Venezuelans, Caracas has become the most violent capital city in Latin America.
In 2019, the homicide rate reached 76 for every 100,000 inhabitants, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (
Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia – OVV)
.
While this statistic represents a drop in violent deaths in comparison with 2018, when, according to the OVV, the homicide rate reached
100 for every 100,000 inhabitants
, the situation continues to be critical and Caracas continues to be among the five most violent states in Venezuela, following Miranda, Bolívar and Aragua.
As in the rest of the country, these violence rates
are the result of homicides
carried out by common and organized criminal actors, as well as
killings
committed by state security forces, including t
he Special Action Forces (
Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales – FAES)
.
The infamous
megabandas
, local armed groups dedicated to extortion, kidnapping, theft, contract killings and drug trafficking, also contribute to the violence.
San Juan, Puerto Rico: 53.5 per 100,000*
In comparison with 2018, in which
144 homicides
were committed, the Puerto Rican capital experienced a significant spike in murders in 2019, wrapping up the year with
172 violent deaths
. San Juan is now ranked as the second deadliest city on this list with 53.5 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants.
According to declarations made by San Juan’s Mayor
Carmen Yulín Cruz
, the homicide rate has grown in several parts of the
island
due to common delinquency, gender-based violence and drug trafficking.

:
InSight Crime’s 2019 Homicide Round-Up
Given that authorities’ attention has been focused on responding to the natural emergencies that Puerto Rico has faced over the last two years, the
island
has become
vulnerable to exploitation
by gangs and transnational criminal organizations, which are using the island more and more as a stopover point for drug shipments.
Guatemala City, Guatemala: 42.5 per 100,000
While the national decline in violent deaths Guatemala has seen in recent years continued in Guatemala City, the capital’s
homicide rate for 2018 of
42.5 homicides per 100,000 residents
remained well above the
national average
of 23.6.
Extortion continues to be one of the main
sources of violence
in Guatemala’s capital. The gangs MS13 and Barrio 18
control large areas
within Guatemala City, where they demand
payments from shopkeepers
, large businesses, drivers for public transport services and garbage collectors, among others.
As observed by InSight Crime during a major
investigation
released in 2019
, these gangs have annual earnings of around three or four million dollars from extortion alone.
This steady flow of income has provided the gangs with the
capital to invest
in other tools necessary for their activities: weapons, wholesale drug purchases and criminal infrastructure.
The situation of violence is accentuated in the capital due to the availability of weapons in the country. In Guatemala, handguns are used for around
75 percent
of killings
, according to data from Guatemala’s National Forensic Science Institute (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Forenses de Guatemala –
INACIF
).
Tegucigalpa, Honduras: 41 per 100,000*
Tegucigalpa experienced a small
decline in homicides
in 2019. The number of violent deaths went from 542 in 2018 to 516 in 2019, a rate of 41 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants.
SEE ALSO:
Honduras Drop in Homicides One Part of Complex Security Situation
The national government has attributed this decline to its security strategy which, between 2012 and 2017, focused on combating
large criminal structures
, dismantling powerful organizations like the
Valles Cartel,
purging the national police of corrupt officials and modernizing its penitentiary system.
Nevertheless, Tegucigalpa continues to be dominated by gangs like MS13 and Barrio 18, that use urban areas as recruitment and operational centers. In fact, the government’s policies seem to have eliminated the competition between the gangs, allowing them to consolidate their power, implementing policies to
reduce violence
in recent years.
San Salvador, El Salvador: 35.3 per 100,000
The homicide rate in San Salvador has declined for another consecutive year with 35.3 violent deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2019, according to the
Northern Triangle Violence Observatory (
Observatorio de Violencia del Triángulo Norte
.)
In 2015, the homicide rate stood at around 108.5 for every 100,000 but it has rapidly declined as the result of a
detente between El Salvador’s main gangs
.
Between 2015 and 2018 the homicide rate fell by 53 percent, with El Salvador’s government taking credit, touting the implementation of new security measures under the
Territorial Control Plan
.
However, evidence suggests that the decline should be attributed more to a concerted effort by MS13 and Barrio 18 to reduce homicide rates and follow a protectionist policy: “to
not [let] anyone mess with civilians
.” In fact, investigators argue that MS13
can increase and decrease the homicide rate at its will,
a tactic used for negotiating with the Salvadoran government.
The gangs, or
maras
, have a particularly strong influence in San Salvador, dividing the neighborhoods in the capital city among them and controlling the streets through
informal points of criminal control
.
Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago: 24.5 per 100,000*
With close to 92
murders in 2019,
the homicide rate reached 24.5 cases for every 100,000 residents, making this one of the most violent years for Port of Spain. The number of homicides registered during the first half of the year represented
82 percent
of the total number of murders registered in 2018.
The deteriorating security situation in Trinidad and Tobago has occurred amidst a struggle within the island nation to combat organized crime, fueled by drug trafficking in the Caribbean and exacerbated by the situation in nearby Venezuela.
In the past,
local gangs
had been identified as responsible for the outbreaks of violence on the island. However, the
arrest
of Evander, the leader of a Venezuelan megabanda
in May 2019, showed that Venezuelan criminal groups have infiltrated the island nation.
Trinidad and Tobago’s strategic location as a transit point for the rest of the Caribbean and markets like the United States and Europe,
is the main reason
for the arrival of these transnational drug trafficking networks to the island.
District of Panama, Panama: 18.5 per 100,000*
With
219 registered homicides
in 2019, the District of Panama, which covers Panama City and its metropolitan area, experienced a 24 percent increase in violent deaths in comparison with 2018’s
176 registered cases
. This increase leaves the District of Panama with a murder rate of 18.5 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants, according to statistics published by the
Attorney General’s Office
.
According to
Rolando Mirones
, Panama’s security minister, the majority of the country’s murders were the result an increase in clashes between gangs.
According to the country’s senior prosecutor for crimes of unlawful association,
Nathaniel Murgas
, police reports established that some 160 gangs operate in the country, with at least 60 operating in Panama City.
Given this context, the
decision by Panamanian authorities
to lift the restriction on arms imports into the country has drawn attention. The restriction on the import of weapons was in effect for almost a decade and its lifting could
drive up violence
at a time in which the homicide rate is already on the rise.
Figures covering only Panama City were not available.
Mexico City, Mexico: 17.6 per 100,000*
In 2019, Mexico City registered the highest rates of violence that the capital has seen in at least 25 years.
According to the Executive Secretariat of the National System of Public Security (Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública – SESNSP), from January to December, 1,557 violent deaths
were registered
in Mexico City. This equates to an average of 4.3 people killed every day.
The
criminal dynamics
faced by the Mexican capital this year was marked by the fragmentation of organized criminal groups and the inability of the government to confront them, along with rampant corruption and collusion within the country’s security forces.

While traditionally authorities in Mexico City have
denied the presence
of large organized criminal groups,
evidence shows
that several local structures operating in the city are linked to organizations with a presence in other states.
Over the last few years, La Unión Tepito and the Tláhuac Cartel have been the capital’s main criminal actors. Both groups have suffered strong blows after much of their leadership have been
arrested
or
killed
but their operations do not appear to have been
diminished
.
And
vigilante self-defense groups
are now emerging to respond to the criminal threat. Mexico City authorities
are investigating
a group known as the
Fuerza Anti Unión
, whose members, tired of
extortions
, kidnappings and
murders
at the hands of La Unión Tepito, decided to take justice into their own hands.
Likewise, capital city authorities
are investigating at least 120 police officers
accused of colluding with this illegal group, providing protection for its members
in exchange for payments
ranging between 18,000 and 20,000 pesos ($919-$1,020) per month.
Montevideo, Uruguay: 14.7 per 100,000*
With approximately
194 violent deaths
and a homicide rate of 14.7 for every 100,000 inhabitants, the Uruguayan capital experimented a slight decrease in homicides with respect to 2018, a year in which
223 cases
were reported.
Nevertheless, the rate remains high for a city that was until recently
considered
an example for the rest of the region.
According to official data published by
Clarín
, 60 percent of these homicides were related to settling of scores between criminals linked to drug trafficking.
This figure is not surprising if the
country’s growing use
as a transshipment point for drug shipments is taken into account. According to statements by the head of the General Directorate for the Suppression of Illicit Drug Trafficking (Dirección General de Represión al Tráfico Ilícito de Drogas – DGRTD), Carlos Noria, 2019 wrapped up with a
historic number of drug seizures
, with approximately 12 tons of cocaine collected around the country.
Bogotá, Colombia: 14.3 per 100,000*
According to the
National Police’s Crime Observatory
, there were 1,032 murders reported in Bogotá in 2019, representing a slight decline with respect to the previous year, with 1,064 violent deaths reported. The 2019 data represents a homicide rate of 14.3 murders for every 100,000 inhabitants.
While the homicide rate fell briefly, there were several cases of
dismembered
victims that, according to authorities, are likely related to
a settling of scores
between micro-trafficking gangs.
After several interventions in the neighborhoods most affected by micro-trafficking in recent years, a
fragmentation process occurred within the local drug market
that has had the greatest effect on the city’s periphery—particularly the neighborhoods of
Ciudad Bolívar, Kennedy and Bosa
.
According to the
Ombudsman’s Office
, it is not uncommon for these organizations to decide to move towards the southwestern part of the city. According to the entity, the neighborhoods that make up this part of the capital have a close relationship with the criminal dynamics operating in the rest of the county and serve as strategic corridor for the entry of drugs and weapons into the capital city.
The explosion of a car bomb at a police training school in Bogotá in January 2019
marked a return to urban warfare
by the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional –
ELN
) in the capital. And they are not the only major criminal group present in the city.
According to the Ombudsman’s Office, there are reports of criminal activity by structures such as Los Paisas, Los Costeños, Los Urabeños and
dissidents
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) inside the city.
Brasilia, Brazil: 13.7 per 100,000*
The homicide rate in Brasilia is low, for being the capital of the country with the
highest number of murders
in all of Latin America. With 408 violent deaths reported between January and June, figures published by Globo show a homicide rate of
13.7 for every 100,000 inhabitants
in the first half of 2019.
Most of the homicides are the result of common crime, and the main security risks in the capital city stem from
robberies and assaults
. Still, small-scale organized criminal groups do
operate in Brasilia
, mainly because the metropolitan area offers a market for the sale of drugs, like cannabis, cocaine, coca paste, crack and
merla
(a byproduct of coca paste).
However, the criminal groups do not compete with the State for control of the capital city, as they do in other cities like Río de Janeiro and São Paulo, where the homicide rates are considerably higher. This dynamic is derived from the nature and structure of Brasilia, that is a well-planned administrative center with a well-equipped and receptive
police force
that offers few opportunities or incentives for criminal elements to thrive.
San José, Costa Rica: 12.9 per 100,000*
In late 2019, the Judicial Investigation Organization
(
Organismo de Investigación Judicial – OIJ)
gave an encouraging statement regarding homicides in Costa Rica, reporting a nationwide decline. The capital, San José, was no exception, with a total of
181 murders
, yielding a rate of 12.9 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants.
But the OIJ stated that the
majority of these violent deaths
continue being the result of a settling of scores between criminal groups, quarrels and assaults involving a firearm.

In August 2019, José Efraín López Mendoza, alias “M-1,” the leader of the Revolutionary Movement of Organized Crime (Movimiento Revolucionario de Crimen Organizado  – Moreco) was
arrested
in the capital city. López Mendoza is accused of drug trafficking and being linked to Mexico kingpin Ismael Zambada García, alias “El Mayo,” the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.
His arrest provided further evidence of the links between
Costa Rican criminal groups and transnational drug trafficking
, related to Costa Rica’s newfound position as a center for the reception, storage and trafficking of drugs.
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: 10.4 per 100,000*
With 100 murders in 2019, Santo Domingo wrapped up 2019 with a rise in violent deaths, resulting in a rate of 10.4 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants, according to data from the
Citizen Security Observatory
. This figure is higher than the national average of 9.5.
The United States State Department has
identified
the Dominican Republic as one of the main transit countries for cocaine shipments traversing the Caribbean. Maritime trafficking, which includes the use of high-speed boats and commercial containers, is the main method for trafficking drugs to the island.
While Dominican criminal structures mainly serve as transporters for organizations in Colombia and Mexico, this has started to change and now Dominican groups are
entering the big leagues,
buying cocaine in Venezuela and taking direct control of the shipments once they reach the island.
Lima, Peru: 8 per 100,000*
Lima presented a total of 745 violent deaths in 2019, with the homicide rate falling at 8 out of every 100,000 inhabitants, according to police figures published in the newspaper
Peru21
. But the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática – INEI) says just 6.5 percent of these homicides are related to organized crime.
Within the metropolitan area of Lima, one of the areas that experienced an uptick in violence was Callao, where
82 murders
took place between January and August 2019. Drug trafficking, extortion and the growing presence of underage hitmen are some of the explanations offered by the police to explain this violence.
According to General Edgardo Garrido, police chief in Callao, the main reason behind the homicides is the
drug trafficking that occurs around Callao’s ports.
Managua, Nicaragua: 6.6 per 100,000*
With an estimated 96 deaths in 2019, based on data published by the
National Police
for the first quarter of the year, Managua is the city with the highest number of homicides in Nicaragua, with a rate of 6.6 for every 100,000 inhabitants.
Although extrajudicial executions on the part of state security forces appear to
have declined since 2018
,
government repression against human rights activists
persists.
Incidents of abuse at the hands of the government and paramilitary forces are concentrated in Managua and are the primary cause of violence in the capital. Despite the clear evidence of the role played by civilian armed groups in repressing anti-government protests since April 2018, administration officials deny the existence of paramilitary groups within the country, calling the reports “
smear campaigns
.”
Asunción, Paraguay: 6.3 per 100,000*
While authorities havee not yet published the country’s murder rate for 2019, the relatively low level of killings seen in recent years in Asunción is atypical compared to Paraguay’s border departments with Brazil, where the homicide rate can rise to over 70 per 100,000 people.
In 2018, the capital saw 33 killings, representing a rate of 6,3 homicides per 100,000 people, which is low compared to the rest of the country. And Asunción has seen homicides gradually decrease since
2010
.

Deadly Riot Shows Paraguay Prisons Unprepared for PCC Onslaught
Unlike the border areas where
clashes
between the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC) and local gangs have sent violence soaring, in Asunción, has been generally attributed to street crime.
But groups like the PCC have thrived inside the capital’s prisons, which are among the most overpopulated in the country. In June 2019, PCC members
massacred 10 members
of Clan Rotela, a Paraguayan prison gang which has grown thanks to controlling the sale of crack in Asunción’s poorer neighborhoods.
While the massace occurred in the regional prison of San Pedro, the dispute had its origins in the National Prison ofTacumbú in Asunción, after a PCC member was
murdered
by Clan Rotela.
In an interview with InSight Crime, the former director of Tacumbú prison, Jorge Fernández,
stated
that the situation in the prison was a ticking time bomb since just 43 guards per shift were in charge of watching almost 4,000 prisoners.
Santiago, Chile: 4.9 per 100,000*
Although Santiago continues to be one of the least violent capitals in Latin America, with a homicide rate of 4.9 for every 100,000 inhabitants according to the Chilean crime and analysis center
(Centro de Estudios y Análisis del Delito – CEAD)
, the capital reported
106 violent deaths
in 2019, including a number due to
violence
during political protests.
Santiago’s 17 percent increase in homicides when compared to the 2018 rate of 1.7, is actually attributed to the government’s violent response to the protests that began in October which have resulted in more than
30 deaths
.
The United Nations’
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR) sent a mission to report on the violent clashes between the security forces and the protestors that concluded that the police responded in a “fundamentally repressive manner,” particularly considering its “use of less lethal ammunition.”
Chile is also a key country for the
transshipment of narcotics
, and its urban centers, particularly Santiago, provide a consumer market for
cocaine
and marijuana, as well as
synthetic drugs
like LSD and ecstasy. Nevertheless, Santiago’s street gangs manage drug distribution with relatively little violence.
Buenos Aires, Argentina: 4.7 per 100,000*
Buenos Aires has historically had a low homicide rate. This year it falls just below the national average of 5 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants, a rate of 4.6, representing
137 violent deaths
in the city in 2018.
However, the fact that this figure is low does not mean that there is little crime in the capital. Most of the criminal activities that occur in Buenos Aires take place on the periphery of the city, specifically in the formal and informal neighborhoods that are not officially considered part of the Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, but rather known as the Greater Buenos Aires area. These neighborhoods are home to most of the groups responsible for drug trafficking in the capital.
Quito, Ecuador: N/A
While Ecuadorian authorities have yet to publish the homicide statistics for the capital city of Quito, the country’s National Institute for Statistics and Census
(Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos – INEC)
reported 1,056 homicides across the country in 2019, which would equate to a homicide rate of about 6.7 for every 100,000 inhabitants.
Quito has traditionally maintained one of the lowest homicide rates in the region. In 2015, it reported a rate of
5.5 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants
.
But despite the homicide rate being low in comparison to other regions, like Sucumbíos or Esmeraldas, Quito is not free of the negative effects of drug trafficking. Ecuador has become one of the world’s
cocaine superhighways
.
La Paz, Bolivia: N/A
While the government has still not published official homicide data for 2019, violence in Bolivia’s capital city, as well as in the rest of the country, was marked this year by the protests that triggered the controversial
departure of President Evo Morales from power
.
In November, at least
23 people died
when military forces opened fire on members of
indigenous communities
in an attempt to violently suppress demonstrators.

SHARE
For three days in mid-February, the ELN made a show of force, staging simultaneous operations in a show of force which sent a clear message to the government about the risks of not pressing ahead with peace talks.
On February 10, 2020, the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN), which InSight Crime named the
most powerful criminal group in Latin America in 2019,
publicly announced
the implementation of an “armed strike” across nine Colombian departments. The strike lasted 72 hours, from February 14 to 17.
Over that time, Colombia saw at least 27 operations by the ELN around the country, including attacks
on electrical infrastructure
,
clashes
with the Colombian Army, closures of national highways due to
bomb threats
, explosive devices
left in cities
,
one sniper attack
, as well as numerous graffitis and flags hailing the group.
SEE ALSO:
ELN News and Profile
Entire rural communities were left
paralyzed
due to the fear of reprisals for not abiding by the group’s orders.
The Colombian government
responded
with the deployment of military units in the departments like Chocó, Bolívar, Cesar, Antioquia and Norte de Santander, according to Uno Noticias. while the army allegedly prevented 94 further operations by the ELN nationwide
, General Luis Fernando Navarro, commander of Colombia’s armed forces, was
quoted
as saying by W Radio.
InSight Crime Analysis
This nationwide show of strength essentially proves that the ELN is Latin America’s only criminal group able to bring large parts of a country to a halt.
It also showed the government the risk of not pressing ahead with peace talks in Cuba, suspended since January 2019, and which the group has
wanted
to resume.
Since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) demobilized after
signing a peace agreement
with the government in 2016, the ELN has swiftly taken control of regions the FARC left behind.
From 2017 to 2019, InSight Crime charted the ELN’s
expansion
from having around 1,400 men to over 4,000. It has also become a transnational group, being
present
in much of Venezuela.

This growth was reflected in the efficiency of its armed strike. The 27 incidents surpassed the 20 events which
marked a similar rally
by the ELN in 2018.
Norte de Santander and Cesar were the most affected areas in February but some of the operations revealed the ELN’s ability to wield power without violence.
I
n Chocó, a department that has been
heavily affected
by the ELN’s Western War Front (Frente de Guerra Occidental), a warning was enough to stop transport along the Istmina River, a key municipality for connecting the department, which led to a
food shortage,
Caracol reported.
A similar situation occurred in Arauca, a department historically controlled by the ELN’s Domingo Laín Sáenz Front, where a significant amount of land transportation and economic activity was halted.
Local media reported
that few businesses opened and that many areas turned into “ghost towns” during the armed strike.
Likewise, in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca’s port city, thousands of people were reportedly unable to travel as
river transportation was
stalled
due to fears of ELN reprisals.
The only comparable recent event
came
in October 2019, when the Sinaloa Cartel mobilized hundreds of gunmen and shut down the city of Culiacán, forcing authorities to release Ovidio Guzmán López, the son of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo.” But while this happened in the Sinaloa Cartel’s backyard, the ELN’s force projection was across a far broader area.
With a presence across Colombia and a capacity to halt activity in entire regions, the ELN may now be able to pressure the national government into returning to the negotiating table in Havana. Peace talks with the group were discontinued after the
ELN’s Bogota attack
on January 21, 2019.

SHARE
The city of Manaus has awoken red in recent weeks: the painting of the Red Command gang’s insignia “CV” on its walls, the chanting of “Vermelho” (red) from its largest prison, and bloodshed throughout its poor neighborhoods.
The capital of Brazil’s northern state of Amazonas is the brutal battleground in a prolonged feud between two drug gangs: the
Red Command
(Comando Vermelho) and Family of the North (Familia do Norte — FDN).
Since January, the Red Command, whose power base is in Rio de Janeiro, has sought to put an end to the war through a
violent takeover
of Manaus. As a result, the city saw
106 murders
in January and a further 55 by February 16, according to
Brazilian media
citing police figures.
SEE ALSO
:
Red Command News and Profile
The Red Command’s bloody campaign has led to it controlling 80 percent of Manaus’ neighborhoods, local newspaper
Em Tempo reported
, quoting police sources.
In February, the Red Command launched an attack into the neighborhood of Compensa, an FDN stronghold in Manaus and home to FDN leader José Roberto Fernandes Barbosa, alias “Zé Roberto da Compensa,”
wrote Em Tempo
.
The violence in Compensa has shaken residents. On February 13, Red Command members
gunned down
a 31-year-old man who came across them while they were tagging walls.
Video of the killing
of Wallemberg Vieira Bello, which surfaced on social media, shows the men spray painting the letters “CV” when several shots are suddenly fired.
Gang members also have made public celebrations of their victories. “Fireworks in every neighborhood. Drug traffickers celebrating the end of a rival faction. Manaus has become Gotham City without Batman,”
wrote one
Twitter user.
The state government of Amazonas, which has shown little capacity to stop the bloodshed,  announced February 10 that it had
created a crisis team
within the government alongside other security measures that included isolating prisoners and halting all visits to prisons.
InSight Crime Analysis
The Red Command’s invasion of Manaus may spell the end of the Family of the North as a major criminal player after
the group’s fracturing
in 2019 and the killing of many of its members in
repeated prison
riots.
A police source
told Em Tempo
that members of the FDN are being told to “become red” or become dead. “There are some who are running away … from not wanting to join the [Red Command] or from fear of being executed,” the police source said.
The source attributed the Red Command’s crushing victory to its use of extreme violence. “They are far more violent. They kill and do it brutally. The FDN was already in a more ‘peaceful’ phase because they were focused on drug trafficking, without many clashes. This is also why they lost the territories so quickly,” the source told the paper.
The list of Manaus neighborhoods in the hands of the Red Command
reportedly includes
Aparecida, Centro, Matinha, Vila da Prata, Cidade de Deus, Ouro Verde and Santa Etelvina.
The FDN was not in any state to fight back. Its war with the Red Command, ever since an alliance between the two gangs
fell apart
in 2018, had been progressively taking its toll. The prisons of Amazonas became the battlegrounds, with dozens dying in
successive assaults.
SEE ALSO:
Brazil Prisons Become Battlegrounds for Familia do Norte Civil War
Worse yet, in May 2019, 55 FDN
prisoners were killed
when one of the gang’s lieutenants, João Pinto Carioca, alias “João Branco,” sought to take over control from Zé Roberto da Compensa.
The FDN has also had trouble keeping its leadership intact. In 2018, FDN leader Gelson Carnaúba, alias “Mano G” — who had forged an alliance between his gangs and the Red Command —
switched sides
and joined the Red Command. In the current invasion of Manaus, graffiti bearing Mano G’s name
has been seen
across the city, suggesting he is playing a crucial role in his former gang’s downfall.
Since February 10, the Red Command reportedly
issued statements
saying that the violence was coming to an end. For at least 48 hours, between February 17 and 19, no homicides
were reported
in the city.

Max Radwin,"The ruins of a Mayan structure, often unguarded for most of the year
SHARE
Guatemalan authorities carried out raids at a shop selling illegally sourced artifacts,
renewing focus on the country’s struggles to stamp out the remains of a once-flourishing black market.
In February, the Prosecutor’s Office for Crimes of Cultural Heritage
recovered
pre-Hispanic pottery as well as obsidian and flint blades at a shop in the northern town of Flores,
El Periodico reported
.
Flores is a colonial town that sits near the heart of ancient Mayan ruins like
Tikal
and
Uaxactun.
Both
of those sites
are regulated for tourism and scientific study, but thousands more continue to go almost entirely unguarded.
In 2018, officials carried out six raids related to archeological looting, according to an Attorney General’s Office investigator who spoke with InSight Crime.
They also managed to reclaim Mayan artifacts that had made it all the way to an auction in
France
.

Only a Fraction of Mexico’s Stolen Cultural Antiquities Are Recovered
In 2013, Carlos Mera, Guatemala’s then-director of cultural patrimony,
said
that nearly all of the country’s 4,000 archaeological sites have had items looted.
InSight Crime Analysis
Raids on local store owners may not be enough to protect Guatemala’s Mayan sites from looting, or to keep antiquities stolen from them off the black market.
Mayan sites were mostly plundered between the 1960s and 80s, when a wave of pre-Colombian exhibitions in the United States increased demand from museums and private collectors, an expert with La Ruta Maya Foundation told InSight Crime. At the same time, Guatemala’s civil war forced some archeologists to flee excavation sites, leaving them exposed to impoverished rural communities in search of additional sources of income.
Looters, known locally as “huecheros,” cut into the sides of Mayan ruins housing jade, tablets and ceramic pottery, among other objects. Then they sold the items to intermediaries in Mexico and Belize. The objects were smuggled in trucks and helicopters along established agricultural and military transport routes.
SEE ALSO:
Guatemala News and Profile
“We never knew if they made it into museums,” one
former huechero, who has robbed between 15 and 20 archeological sites throughout Guatemala and southern Mexico, told InSight Crime. “But I would bet that a majority did. That’s why they were being bought.”
The black market today mostly comprises small pieces like shells, jewelry and bones featuring detailed carvings and calligraphy. These are easier to sneak through airport security and other travel checkpoints. It’s also easy to find such items in local shops, like the one raided in Flores.
Today, the
origin
of cultural artifacts is becoming an increasingly
hot-button
issue
for museums and auction houses, and international demand for large, new pieces appears to be slowing.
C
urrent
law designates
all of Guatemala’s archeological artifacts as government property. But collectors can sidestep legal risk because once a piece is entered into a national registry — regardless of how it was obtained — it becomes legal to have in their possession, according to a legal source who spoke to InSight Crime.
Guatemalan authorities step in when someone tries to remove, sell or transport one of these pieces without proper registration, a crime that could result in
penalties
as harsh as
15 years in prison, as well as a fine of 10,000 quetzales (about $1,300).
But the Ministry of Culture and Sports, which is
tasked with combatting
the archeological black market, has one of the smallest annual
budgets
of any agency in Guatemala. In 2019 it received under 137 million quetzales ($17.8 million) for the protection and restoration of cultural patrimony. The Ministry of National Defense, meanwhile, spent about six times that just on administrative costs.
Mexico, by comparison,
budgeted
800 million pesos (roughly $43 million) last year for the study, protection and preservation of cultural sites, many of them Mayan.
Without the means to protect such sites in Guatemala, the trafficking of Mayan antiquities will likely continue, with small-scale traders robbing the country piece by piece.

Max Radwin,"Protesters march against human trafficking in Bolivia.
SHARE
An investigation in Bolivia has found that human trafficking goes largely unchecked throughout the country, highlighting the government’s need to address ineffective regulations and a lack of resources to help victims.
Bolivia’s Ombudsman’s Office
said in a January report
that over 71 percent of human trafficking victims had not received attention or protection from the government over the last two years, putting them at risk of falling victim to further exploitation in the future.
Last year, authorities registered 299 cases of human trafficking, a drop from the 465 in 2018, according to the report.
A disproportionate
number
of victims are poor, indigenous and live in rural areas. Most of them were lured into sex trafficking or forced labor in the mining, agricultural and livestock sectors, the report said. Sex trafficking—especially of women and young girls—is common on a domestic scale but can sometimes extend to an international network with Chile, Brazil and countries overseas.
SEE ALSO:
‘Gota a Gota’ Extortionists Expand in Bolivia by Preying on Venezuela Migrants
There have been some attempts at international cooperation. In January, the Attorney General’s Office
requested
help from the Malaysian government while investigating a Bolivian woman who had been forced to travel there. “I didn’t want to come,” she texted her mother, “they brought me, they told me if I didn’t come they would kill me.”
After having spent years on the US State Department’s “watch list,” Bolivia was downgraded to the “
black list
” in 2018 with 21 other countries that had failed to meet the minimum international standards of fighting human trafficking.
In 2019, it was re-upgraded to the “
watch list
” after making some basic strides in investigating and convicting traffickers.
InSight Crime Analysis
The recent report from the Ombudsman’s Office demonstrates that Bolivia continues to fail to help human trafficking victims for three key reasons.
First, although the country has nearly two dozen laws in place to fight various forms of trafficking, experts say they are poorly implemented and even forgotten. For example, each of Bolivia’s nine departments are required to create a human trafficking action plan. But La Paz and Pando don’t have one.
SEE ALSO:
Human Trafficking Complaints Rise by 500 Percent in Chile
Meanwhile, other laws are written so vaguely that they are difficult to follow. Local media outlet
Pagina Siete
pointed out that one law fails to specify whether it is the government or the aggressors who are responsible for victim reparations, or whether the reparations should come in the form of direct payment or compensation of psychological services.
Second, Bolivia offers few resources to victims of human trafficking, making it easier for them to re-enter situations of exploitation in the future. Currently, the country only has six help centers for victims. In its report, the Ombudsman recommended that officials work on opening more in underserved areas of the country.
Third, human trafficking is one of the
most difficult
crimes to enforce and prosecute, in part because it takes so many forms and occurs to the most vulnerable, voiceless parts of the population. Often, victims are unaware that they are victims, or worry that reporting the crime will result in retaliation from the people exploiting them.
Because Bolivia is considered a “transit country” with widespread rural areas that lack government presence, these basic challenges are only exacerbated and require that officials improve the measures currently in place.

Chris Dalby and Charlotte Dierkes,"The sight of children bearing arms in Guerrero has brought global attention to attacks by Los Ardillos on indigenous communities
SHARE
Images of children as young as six toting machine guns have gone around the world, but they are only the latest worrying development in the rapidly shifting criminal landscape of the mountains of Guerrero, Mexico.
On January 18, ten musicians belonging to the Nahuas Indigenous community
were
attacked and killed in Chilapa, Guerrero. The attack was
blamed
on Los Ardillos, a criminal group long entrenched in the area, by the Attorney General’s Office of Guerrero.
As an immediate response, the Chilapa branch of an Indigenous militia known as the Regional Coordination of Community Authorities-Founding Peoples (Coordinadora Regional de Autoridades Comunitarias-Pueblos Fundadores – CRAC-PF) presented 19 children, aged between six and 15, as the newest recruits to defend the communities against recurrent attacks by Los Ardillos,
reported
Proceso.
“Every three or four days, criminal groups are threatening us with invading our community,” Bernardino Sánchez Luna, a founder of the CRAC-PF militia,
told
Vice in early February. “We are preparing the children, so that if they lose their fathers or mothers, they can defend themselves.”
This is not the first time children have been drafted to fight against Los Ardillos and their deadly rivals, Los Rojos. In May 2019, a video of children carrying weapons was
released
by an indigenous militia from Rincón de Chautla, in the municipality of Chilapa.
In a state where indigenous communities have long had to
defend themselves
, Los Ardillos stick out as a relentless oppressor. In October, a few short months after the first video of armed children circulated, at least 150 Ardillos members reportedly stormed into Rincón de Chautla and were confronted by 30 CRAF-PF militia members in a clash that left two dead, Sin Embargo
reported
.
In January 2019, another clash between Los Ardillos and community police in the communities of Zoyapesco and Rincón de Chautla left 12 dead and two injured, Guerrero’s state security secretariat
told
Jornada.
InSight Crime Analysis
For over 20 years ago, Los Ardillos
have been dedicated
to drug trafficking in the mountains of Guerrero. But as the heroin trade has begun drying up, the group has sought to branch out.
Heroin still remains a steady earner, even if it’s not from what it was, and opportunities for mining and even political control beckon. “There’s a cluster of incentives (for Los Ardillos attacks on indigenous communities). While the overall poppy market has shrunk, controlling these lands still means getting to make money from protection. Secondly, mining has become a key conflict driver in many parts of Guerrero,” said Falko Ernst, senior analyst for Mexico for the International Crisis Group.
“La Montaña is no exception, entailing clashes between armed groups pushing for aggressive exploitation and indigenous populations looking to defend their lands,” Ernst told InSight Crime.
Back in 2015, reports also
emerged
of Los Ardillos ramping up their involvement in alternate criminal economies although extortion and kidnapping had always been part of their modus operandi.
Los Ardillos’ ambitions have not expanded further than Guerrero and they have fought a decade-long turf war there with an offshoot of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel,
known as Los Rojos.
After the
Beltrán Leyva Cartel
disintegrated, its control of Guerrero faded with it, and Los Ardillos emerged as a strong pretender to the throne. The group was
reportedly
founded by a former policeman, Celso Ortega Rosas, alias “La Ardilla” (The Squirrel), who grew poppy in Quechultenango, Guerrero, just 45 kilometers by road from Chilapa. After Ortega Rosas was
murdered
in 2011, three of his sons took over the group and continued the war with Los Rojos.
The video of the armed children may have triggered a change, however. At a press conference on January 31, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador
commented
on the news directly, calling it “an abuse.” He promised to deal with the issue. The local governor, Héctor Antonio Astudillo Flores,
visited
Chilapa in early February, and the National Guard has been
deployed
in the area.
Since then, a tentative agreement has been reached to disarm the 19 children, pending the release of jailed members of the indigenous guard and a guarantee of access to education for the young people in the community, Sánchez Luna told the press on February 11.
This is not the first time a security response in Mexico has been formulated based on a viral news story. In 2019, López Obrador
sent in
the National Guard to deal with the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, a group dedicated to oil theft in Guanajuato, after their leader
directly threatened
the Mexican president and his troops.
But Ernst is pessimistic about the chance for change. “We’re miles off from a real strategy to turn things around in Guerrero and I don’t believe the images of child soldiers will change this,” he said.
For him, a successful intervention would require a “type of Marshall Plan” addressing economic factors, providing physical protection to the most vulnerable populations, addressing permanent corruption, and rebuilding the entire state security apparatus from scratch.

The evidence used to indict several high-ranking politicians in El Salvador for negotiating with gangs has been around for years, raising questions about why prosecutors are bringing the cases now, and what President Nayib Bukele stands to gain.
In February, El Salvador’s
Attorney General’s Office charged
a handful of lawmakers, mayors and ministers from both the country’s main political parties with electoral fraud and conspiracy. They are accused of offering cash and public projects to leaders of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gangs in exchange for their political backing in gang-controlled areas during the runup to the 2014 presidential elections.
As far back as early 2016, video evidence leaked showing that officials in both the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista – ARENA) and left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional — FMLN) met with gang members to curry political favor.
One video —
released
by investigative news outlet El Faro — shows current San Salvador mayor Ernesto Muyshondt seeking gang support for Norman Quijano, the ARENA candidate who narrowly lost in 2014. Prosecutors have charged Muyshondt and others of offering to funnel the gangs $100,000 to help ARENA on the second-round ballot.
Later in 2016, InSight Crime, Revista Factum and El Faro
released two separate videos
of FMLN officials Arístides Valencia and Benito Lara negotiating with gang leaders. Valencia and Lara, who went on to become high-level officials in the government of former President Salvador Sánchez Céren (2014-2019), are accused of offering $150,000 to the gangs to provide support for their party.
More
evidence of secret
negotiations — including videos, photos, and transcripts of intercepted calls – also emerged during a mass trial of some 400 gang members in late 2019. The MS13 leader Noé, a key government witness in the trial,
testified that representatives
of both parties had negotiated with the gangs during election season.
Though that trial occurred just last year, Noé had turned
over videos to prosecutors
as early as 2016. In one, Quijano promises investments in rehabilitation centers if gang leaders helped his campaign,
according to El Faro
, which had access to a transcription. Prosecutors have asked legislators to strip immunity from Quijano, who is currently a congressman, so that he can be formally charged with conspiracy and election fraud.
InSight Crime Analysis
The sudden indictment of the politicians raises suspicions that the prosecutions are politically motivated. Bukele had an acrimonious split from the FMLN in 2017, while he was mayor of San Salvador. And some of the accused are President Bukele’s staunchest rivals.
What’s more, arrangements with gangs are not unusual in El Salvador: members of the president’s inner circle allegedly made similar secret deals when Bukele was mayor.
“It’s just fine that they are doing this investigation,” Jeannette Aguilar, a violence and security investigator in El Salvador, told InSight Crime. “But even so—for years, the prosecution has had several major elements to start this.”
Attorney General Raúl Melara, who has been in office for just over a year, had for months pledged to prosecute “whoever was involved” in gang negotiations. He reiterated
this sentiment on Twitter
when news of the indictments came out on February 1.
Yet Melara has seemingly turned a blind eye to evidence of similar meetings between gang leaders and officials close to Bukele, which occurred while Bukele was San Salvador’s mayor (2015-2018).
In 2015, two officials with Bukele’s mayoral administration — Mario Durán, a minister under Bukele, and Carlos Marroquín, who leads special projects division that does work in areas under gang control — met with MS13 gang leaders at a Pizza Hut outside San Salvador,
El Faro reported in 2018
.
During the meeting, the gang bosses demanded $10,000 in exchange for allowing future projects in the city to go ahead, according to the
El Faro investigation
. The officials refused but offered construction materials.
The meeting was observed by undercover police agents,
court documents
later revealed.
Though the officials were unable to reach an agreement with the gangs during that meeting, Bukele’s mayoral administration ultimately made a series of deals with them to push forward important development projects in San Salvador’s Historic Center. Concessions included giving the gangs designated market space and even employing them as security at events, El Faro reported.
In turn, the administration was able to revamp the space. New businesses opened and the revitalized city center became a central component of the
Bukele campaign narrative
.
Gang members and Bukele campaign officials who spoke to El Faro also said that when Bukele ran for mayor, the gangs were paid to keep them from interfering with his campaign.
Neither Marroquín, Durán, or any official close to Bukele has been charged with any crimes. When asked about the discrepancy, Attorney General’s Office spokeswoman Rosa Isabel Arce told InSight Crime that she could not provide details from cases that have not been processed to avoid interference. She also said cases are prosecuted when prosecutors have “robust elements of proof.”
Marcela Galeas, a criminal defense lawyer, called the selective prosecution of Bukele’s rivals concerning. “I can’t say for what motive or reason there is to pursue this crime at the moment, but there is going to be a political cost for both institutions, ARENA and FMLN, that’s a fact,” she told InSight Crime.
Galeas also noted that with the recent indictments, “There’s a connection between the wishes of the president and the actions of the Attorney General.”
By law, El Salvador’s Attorney General and office of the President operate independently. But since taking office in June 2019, Bukele has gotten into the habit of publicly pressuring Melara  — including on
Twitter
, his go-to medium — into opening investigations.
“The least we can demand is Norman Quijano’s resignation and that Attorney General [Raúl Melara] prosecute those involved,” Bukele
tweeted
in October 2019, three months before Melara announced the cases.
Meanwhile, the gang negotiation cases have become politically convenient for Bukele as he battles the country’s congress — where ARENA and FMLN
hold 60 of 84 seats
. Bukele came to power in 2019, as the candidate for the small, conservative Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional – GANA) party. He ran on a platform of dismantling
a corrupt political system
he says has been long dominated by the same faces, yet GANA has long been known for its own corrupt practices.
Bukele’s fight with the two traditional parties came to a head on February 9 when he effectively stormed the legislative assembly,
surrounded by armed police and military personnel
, in a staged effort to pressure legislators to vote on a $109 million loan. The loan, if approved, would fund the third phase of Bukele’s
Territorial Control Plan
, which seeks to return public order to areas under gang control. Bukele is seeking the funds to purchase a helicopter, police cars, uniforms, night vision goggles, and a camera surveillance system.
Bukele’s militarized standoff was widely condemned
inside
El Salvador and
abroad
.
Bukele defended his actions on Twitter. In an inflammatory storm of tweets, he accused ARENA and FMLN legislators of
financing the gangs
and of offering them “
firing ranges to train to kill Salvadorans
.”
In all, seven people were indicted in the gang negotiation cases, including former Security Minister Lara, former Interior Minister Valencia and current San Salvador Mayor Muyshondt. Whether legislators will strip immunity from Quijano still needs to be determined. They are expected to debate this matter in the coming weeks.

Social leaders across Colombia were murdered at an almost unprecedented rate in 2019, and for a wide range of causes. Criminal gangs seeking to protect their illegal economies, such as drug traffickers and illegal mining, have been the main culprits.
But demobilized guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), politicians, land defenders, and Indigenous leaders have all been targeted, making specific reasons difficult to pin down.
Below, InSight Crime looks at these murders in Putumayo, Nariño, Antioquia, Cauca and Norte de Santander, the five Colombian departments most impacted by this spike in violence, as well as the difficulty in knowing exactly how many leaders have been targeted.
Uncertainty About the Numbers
A number of organizations monitor this issue closely, including Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office, the United Nations and a range of civil society groups. But due to the difficulty in gathering reliable information about how and when these murders occur, statistics can vary widely.
A total of 872 social leaders and human rights defenders were killed in Colombia between January 1, 2016 and September 8, 2019, according to the Institute for Development and Peace Studies (
Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz — INDEPAZ)
. This breaks down to 132 murders in 2016, 208 in 2017, 282 in 2018 and a slight drop to
250 reported killings
in 2019
.
SEE ALSO:
Why Are Political Candidates Being Assassinated in Colombia?
But according to Diana Sánchez, director of the human rights organization Programa Somos Defensores (We Are Defenders Program), the phenomenon is actually under-reported. “We have detected a trend of underestimating the number of murders. A few years ago, they were explained away as matters of passion or territory disputes. Then they were related to coca crops and drug trafficking. Now they say that they [those killed] were not social leaders or human rights defenders,” Sánchez commented to
Deutsche Welle
.
This disparity in the numbers has meant that a lot of attention has been placed on the
statistics
, detracting focus from why these killings were happening in the first place.
The
motivations
are related to the work done by Colombian social leaders to promote the implementation of the 2016 peace accords between the government and the FARC, as well as their efforts to stem the flow of illegal economies within their territories.
In many cases, the leaders killed were involved in efforts to offer alternatives to coca farmers, such as
crop substitution programs
or
land redistribution.
They are also attacked for defending their territories’ natural resources, particularly in standing against
illegal mining
or logging, or defending their use of water sources.
SEE ALSO:
Colombia News and Profiles
As a result of the compromise reached as part of the peace agreement, many
former FARC combatants
have also become the targets of threats, murders and other forms of violence on the part of different armed groups and
state forces
.
Among the reasons behind these attacks are refusing to return to illegal activities, promoting crop substitution and the mistrust of armed actors operating within the same territory.
During an interview with the newspaper
El País
, Martha Mancera, director of the Unit to Dismantle Criminal Gangs within the Attorney General’s
Office, stated that 2019 closed with 132 murders of former FARC combatants, nine of whom were victims of forced displacement, 107 were homicide victims and 16 were classified as attempted murders.
Additionally, at least 41
family members of demobilized
FARC fighters were also murdered within the same time frame. In 2017, 15 instances were reported, while 11 were reported in 2018 and 15 in 2019.
While this violence has reached different corners of Colombia, the criminal dynamics in the following five regions have intensified the most over the past year.
Bajo Cauca: A War Zone
In this region of Antioquia department, made up of the municipalities of Zaragoza, Nechí, Cáceres, Tarazá, El Bagre and Caucasia, Colombia’s war hasn’t let up since 2016. Even before the signing of the FARC’s peace agreement in 2016, Bajo Cauca was one of the most troubled areas in Colombia.
Two groups are responsible for the incessant homicides and forced displacements: El Bloque Virgilio Peralta, or the
Caparrapos
, and the
Urabeños
. There are also reports of the presence of dissidents of the FARC’s 18th and 36th Fronts, as well as the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional —
ELN
).
The dispute is currently being waged between the Urabeños and the Caparrapos — which
broke off from the Urabeños
at the end of 2017 — to ensure control of illicit economies like illegal mining, drug trafficking and extortion in areas like Tarazá.
The burnt vehicle in which the body of mayoral candidate Karina Garcia who was found in Suarez, Colombia, on September 2, 2019
About
30 homicides
occurred in Bajo Cauca within just the first 20 days of January 2020, with Tarazá and Cáceres being the municipalities most affected. Two of these victims, killed in the rural Guáimaro de Tarazá settlement, were
community leaders.
Pedro Alexander San Pedro and Carlos Andrés Chavarria belonged to the National Comprehensive Program for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (Programa Nacional Integral de Sustitución de Cultivos Ilícitos — PNIS).
Norte de Santander: The Coca Stronghold
According to a recent
report
from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
, with 33,568 hectares of coca crops, Norte de Santander has the second greatest coca crop coverage in Colombia after Nariño. This has made it a highly demanded corridor for smuggling drugs and contraband in and out of Venezuela, with which it shares a border.
In its northern region of Catatumbo, the ELN’s Northeastern War Front (Frente de Guerra Nororiental), the 33rd Front of the ex-FARC Mafia, the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación —
EPL
) and the
Rastrojos
all have a strong presence. The ELN and the EPL
have been fighting
a particularly bloody war there.

Following the signing of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC in 2016, 42 social leaders and human rights defenders have been murdered here, according to statistics from
INDEPAZ
. The motivation behind these murders is largely related to the
realignment
that has taken place within all these groups, which are vying to benefit from coca, contraband, extortion and arms trafficking.
Despite the national government having regularly
increased its military presence
in the region, there are no signs of the violence decreasing. Two social leaders have already been assassinated in 2020 alone:
César Tulio Sandoval Chía
in Tibú and
Fernando Quintero Mena
in Convención.
Cauca: The Murder Epicenter
The department hardest hit by the assassinations of social leaders in 2019 was Cauca, with
36 cases
as of October. In the first three weeks of 2020, at least
three victims
were reported, with the most recent murder taking place in the municipality of
Guapi
.
While the situation is critical across the department, the dynamic of violence is different in each area. Northern Cauca is under the control of FARC dissidents, specifically the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, led by “El Indio,” and the Jaime Martínez Mobile Column, led by alias
“Mayimbú.”
The latter i
s allegedly responsible for at least
two massacres
in November 2019, including the high-profile murder of
mayoral candidate
Karina García
in Suárez municipality.
SEE ALSO:
Why Are Social Leaders Dying in Colombia’s Cauca?
Both groups maintain a
non-aggression and cooperation
pact
in the department, where they run illegal mining and drug trafficking operations. They also control important routes, such as one heading down from Jamundí in the Valle del Cauca towards northern Cauca and the Naya River corridor leading to the Pacific Ocean.
Unlike the municipalities close to the Pacific, where violence has not been as severe, the situation in northern Cauca has intensified due to
Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities
opposing their lands being used for coca crop cultivation and illegal mining.
Groups of “
Indigenous guards
” in municipalities like Toribio, Corinto and Caloto have arrested several dissidents and seized and destroyed large quantities of weapons and drugs. In areas like Suárez, Buenos Aires and Santander de Quilichao, the Afro-Colombian communities have also spoken out about
the use of mercury and heavy machinery
for mining, which has severely polluted local rivers.
Relatives of mayoral candidate Karina Garcia, who was killed in southern Colombia, cry as they embrace one of her political banners, in Suarez, Colombia,
However, the FARC dissidents are not the only ones responsible for the violence in Cauca. The presence of the ELN’s
José María Becerra Front
has also been reported towards the center and south of the department, in municipalities like
El Tambo
, Popayán, Sucre and Mercaderes. Attacks on civilians in areas like
Argelia
have been attributed to the group.
Nariño: Land Mired in Conflict
As the
country’s top drug-producing
region, Nariño is a criminal paradise. It offers plentiful opportunities for illegal gold mining and numerous departure points for drugs along its southern border with Ecuador.
Nariño’s strategic location has seen the armed groups operating there constantly fighting for territorial control. This has had a profound impact on local communities. Between 2016 and October 2019, at least
75 social,
community, agricultural and human rights leaders were killed in Nariño.
In the municipalities connecting the Pacific Ocean to the interior of the department, the violence is largely due to
clashes between ex-FARC Mafia
groups, namely the United Guerrillas of the Pacific (Guerrillas Unidas del Pacífico — GUP) and the Oliver Sinisterra Front (Frente Oliver Sinisterra — FOS), while drug trafficking mafias like
Los Contadores
also operate in the area.
While the municipality of Tumaco has reportedly seen a
non-aggression pact
brokered between the FOS and the GUP, there have been intense clashes between the groups throughout the rest of the region. The FOS also continues to face off with Los Contadores and, more recently, a
splinter group
known as the Alfonso Cano Eastern Bloc. Fights with the latter have resulted in
numerous forced displacements
.
Meanwhile, towards the mountain ranges in the northeastern part of the department, the ELN’s Manuel Vásquez Front, the FARC dissident group known as the Estiven Gonzales Front, and the Urabeños’s Héroes de la Cordillera, all maintain a presence.
Putumayo: Silent Violence
According to the
UNODC
, Putumayo has the third-largest coverage of coca crops in Colombia, but this is but the tip of its criminal iceberg. Putumayo lies on the border of both Ecuador and Peru, it has access to the Caquetá and Putumayo rivers that connect the region to the eastern part of the country, and it is a hotbed for arms and drug trafficking, extortion, homicides and forced displacements.
Drug trafficking continues to be the engine of war in Putumayo. Dissidents from the
FARC’s former 1st Front
continue to operate in
the municipality of Puerto Asís
. In this area, as in Puerto Leguizamo, there is a war between a FARC dissident group called the Carolina Ramírez Front, and the criminal alliance known as the
Sinaloa Mafia
.
The Sinaloa Mafia maintains a
criminal alliance
with La Constru, a structure that controls microtrafficking activities in the municipalities of Puerto Asís, Orito, La Hormiga, San Miguel and Valle del Guamuez.
But what is most concerning to authorities and local communities is the rampant rate of murders in the municipality of Puerto Guzmán, particularly in the first few weeks of 2020.
On the night of January 6, hitmen on a motorcycle
killed
Gloria Ocampo, a recognized leader that supported crop substitution programs in the region.
Her murder represented the first act of violence registered against social leaders and human rights defenders in 2020. According to civil society
records
, at least
27 social leaders have been murdered
since the start of the new year, or almost
one murder per day
.
Just two days after Ocampo’s death, two more leaders,
Gentil Hernández and Óscar Quintero
, met similar fates in the rural areas of El Mango and Caño Zabala. A week later
Yordan Tovar
, the
head of a union for
rural workers in Putumayo (
Sindicato de Trabajadores Campesinos Fronterizos del Putumayo) was also killed.
The deaths of leaders like Gloria Ocampo, Gentil Hernández, Óscar Quintero and Yordan Tovar are all included within what is being referred to as a
“death caravan”
of killers who roam around the municipality at night on motorcycles, knock on the doors of their victims and call them by name before killing them without hesitation.
This is a common modus operandi seen throughout Colombia.

SHARE
Political kidnappings carried out by pro-government paramilitary groups are going unreported by officials in Nicaragua, revealing another way President Daniel Ortega has masked insecurity and clamped down on his opposition.
Since widespread protests erupted in April 2018, politically motivated kidnappings have skyrocketed, according to figures from civil society and human rights groups. Government statistics, meanwhile, ignore this trend, according to local news organization
La Lupa
.
In past years, kidnappings in Nicaragua were relatively few and mostly carried out with the goal of extorting victims. The highest number of such kidnappings in the last five years came in 2017 with six cases. Five cases were recorded in 2013 and 2015, while 2016 saw just four, according to police data cited by
La Lupa
.
SEE ALSO:
Nicaragua News and Profile
But data collected by civil society and human rights groups over the past two years of unrest in Nicaragua shows kidnappings have spiked exponentially.
In one four month period last year, a report from the Political Prisoners Committee found that 10 political kidnappings were taking place every day, according to
local media reports
. Victims are often arbitrarily
thrown into clandestine jails
or, in the worst cases,
later found dead
.
Between April and September 2018 alone, the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights (Asociación Nicaragüense Pro-Derechos Humanos – AN
PDH)
recorded at least
512 deaths and 1,428 kidnappings. It’s unclear exactly how many more kidnappings have occurred since the report was released.
The advocacy group also noted the possible presence of
clandestine graves
.
InSight Crime Analysis
As
InSight Crime warned
in 2018, it appears that Nicaragua’s paramilitary groups have evolved from “political shock troops” violently repressing the opposition to criminal syndicates carrying out coordinated kidnappings at the orders of political elites. And the government appears to be hiding the scale of their criminality.
Nicaragua has long been considered much safer than its neighbors in Central America. Kidnappings were few and tended to be aimed at small-scale extortion. But today political kidnappings executed by groups of pro-government paramilitary forces armed with high-caliber weapons have become the norm, according to La Lupa’s interview with Nicaragua national security expert Elvira Cuadra.
“Paramilitary groups are one of the most serious threats to security in Nicaragua, especially since they have been encouraged by the government and enjoy impunity,” Cuadra told La Lupa. “That affects all citizens and makes them potential victims of these groups, either for political reasons or for common crimes.”

High-ranking members of the Nicaraguan
military
have
denied the existence or presence
of paramilitary groups, despite
well-documented evidence
of their role in everything from torture to forced disappearances and
extrajudicial killings
.
Though the number of recorded homicides in Nicaragua
has decreased
, violence aimed at the opposition continues unabated. Dissenters still face arrest or assault from pro-government activists.
The
ongoing abuses
carried out by paramilitary groups and the government itself suggests that the country’s security situation is dire, even if a product of its own making.

Robert Muggah and Pedro Augusto Pereira*,"Cameras in favelas have been deployed across Rio de Janeiro
SHARE
Rio de Janeiro’s ultra-conservative governor, Wilson Witzel, was elected in 2018 on a tough-on-crime ticket. Like his erstwhile ally, President Jair Bolsonaro, who vowed to let criminals “
die in the street like cockroaches
,” Witzel promised to “slaughter” and “dig graves” for anyone getting in the way of his crime-fighting agenda.
Since Witzel took office urging the police to use more forceful tactics, overall crime is down, but civilian deaths have soared. Rio’s police reportedly killed
1,810 people in 2019
, an 18 percent increase over 2018 — and the highest toll since records began more than 20 years ago.
One of Witzel’s campaign pledges was to ramp up the use of technology. Before his inauguration, the governor
visited Israel
to look at drones equipped with sniper rifles and promised to install 30,000 new cameras, though this surveillance program has yet to lift off. But he did dispatch
120 sniper shooters
in helicopters to fly over the city’s favelas telling them to “aim for the head” of gun-carrying suspects and recently revived his predecessors’ “pacifying police units” program equipping policemen with body cameras connected to facial recognition technology.

.
Witzel is not the only official experimenting with tech to lower crime. Back in the early 2000s, São Paulo led the way by digitizing crime stats and deploying mapping software, including
InfoCrime
and
Detecta
. These and other reforms are
credited
with a major drop in crime. In cities across Brazil, local authorities are erecting
digital walls
: cameras lining access roads in order to track license plates. At least five state police forces rolled out facial recognition pilots in 2019, linking them to the
arrests of at least 151 people
.
SEE ALSO
:
Death From Above: The Use of Police Helicopters in Rio de Janeiro
Brazil’s
federal police
is among the world’s first to deploy Israeli-manufactured military drones. Some state police forces are also developing
crime prediction capabilities
that combine machine learning and crime datasets to estimate the probability of events occurring. While prone to
criticism
and vulnerable to bias, there is
evidence
that some predictive tools can help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of policing. Pilots involving crime forecasting are already underway in
Rio de Janeiro
,
Fortaleza
and
Santa Catarina
.
Brazil is far from the only Latin American country jumping on the security-tech bandwagon. Across the region governments, police and private companies are testing out different tools. Take the case of
Buenos Aires
, which is integrating facial recognition into its existing surveillance camera infrastructure. Other Argentine cities like
Cordoba
and
Mendoza
are following suit. In
Lima
, municipalities are quietly ramping-up facial recognition. And in Mexico,
Coahuila
state recently announced its intention to combine facial recognition capabilities to its newly acquired 1,100 surveillance cameras.
How clear is the picture?
Wherever adopted, facial recognition and crime prediction platforms are only as good as the underlying data and how the tools are managed. MIT researcher
Joy Buolamwini
has shown how facial recognition systems register error rates of 34.7 percent for black women as compared to just 0.8% for white men. In countries like Brazil, in which
64 percent of the prison population is black
, there are real risks that recognition tools could go spectacularly wrong.
When it comes to crime prediction, one needs to account for the unreliability of existing data and systematic reporting biases. In the US, for example,
low-income communities
that are heavily-policed virtually always register “more” crime than the average. And in Brazil, there are often vast
“no-go areas”
suffering information blackouts where police are simply not present at all.
All of these information asymmetries
can fundamentally distort the predictions
generated by crime forecasting tools. This can reinforce existing biases to the detriment of public safety, especially of the most vulnerable.
Crime prediction and facial recognition tools can also be highly invasive and undermine civil liberties if poorly managed. Some tools are more problematic than others.
Place-based prediction
estimates the probable “risk” of events occurring at specific times and in particular geographic locations.
People-based predictions
hoover up public and personal data of individuals to infer the risk that they might perpetrate a crime or be a victim (or both).

Some of these systems rely on information of a highly personal nature. Few companies, however, are inclined to release information about how their tech works. Moreover, the
high level of complexity
of some algorithms means that even their developers often struggle to explain how they work.
Nevertheless, there are ways to limit biases and improve the accountability and transparency of security technologies. At a minimum, developers must test algorithms for fairness and discrimination. This means statistically modeling the direct and indirect effects of formulas to determine their effects on certain subgroups according to their race, income, gender, age or otherwise.
Companies can also introduce
social impact strategies
to clarify biases, explain how data is used, and provide more information to the public. This means ensuring algorithms are explainable; clarifying the police responsibilities when it comes to the data collected; describing the accuracy of the predictions — and their limitations; providing options to audit the algorithm on the ground; and explaining how the system ensures privacy, in-line with existing laws and practices.
If designed and deployed with fidelity and care, new technologies can generate positive improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of public security. A recent study by
McKinsey
determined that certain data-driven tools can help reduce fatalities by up to 10 percent, lower crime incidents by as much as 40 percent and dramatically reduce emergency response times.
SEE ALSO:
Brazil News and Profile
This is not guaranteed just by procuring and implementing facial recognition or crime prediction solutions. Clear direction on how these tools will be used, regular training, legal and ethical safeguards to limit misuse, and regular testing and evaluation is essential. Their rollout should also be accompanied by a public campaign to explain what these tools are, how they affect privacy, and citizens’ right to recourse.
The costs and benefits of security tech need to be publicly debated. If communities in democratic societies reject the technology, as they have in places like
San Francisco
, then they stand very little chance of being successful. On the other hand,
new technologies for public security
can also generate important savings, if deployed intelligently. Crime-mapping platforms, CCTV cameras, smart lights and body cameras can reduce unproductive expenditure on law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, judges and penal authorities.
The point is that while public security technologies are being widely deployed in Brazil and across Latin America, they need to be carefully administered and evaluated. But they are far from a panacea. Moreover, if they are deployed without oversight, they can generate counterproductive results. A key lesson is that if facial recognition and crime prediction is to be used, it should be accompanied with a public debate. Safeguards to protect data and strategies to measure outcomes — with independent specialists — are not optional extras, but fundamental to their success.

The arrest of crime boss “El Contador,” who is accused of being one of Colombia’s most powerful traffickers, could further stoke violence in Nariño, a coca-rich department.
On February 21, President Iván Duque announced the arrest of
José Albeiro Arrigui, alias “El Contador.” An elite police unit captured Arrigui at an encampment in jungle region of the Caquetá department.
Arrigui allegedly financed cocaine production and controlled cocaine trafficking in the Pacific municipality of Tumaco in Nariño, Colombia’s greatest coca-growing region. He also is accused of attacking demobilized members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC).

It is believed that Contador
moved
between the small towns of Vaquerio, Sabaleta, Llorente and Caunapi in Tumaco, and that his group, Los Contadores, is responsible for the forced displacement of Awá Indigenous communities in this region,
according
to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia – ONIC).
He also allegedly has links to
Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel
, whose emissaries have visited Tumaco to negotiate drug shipments and tp ensure the quality of the cocaine, according to International Crisis Group.
Prior to running his own group and before the signing of the 2016 FARC peace agreement, Contador was reportedly instrumental to the drug trafficking business of the FARC’s Daniel Aldana Mobile Column and 29th Front, investigators from the Attorney General’s Office told
El Tiempo.
InSight Crime Analysis
Contador stands out for taking advantage of alliances to position himself as a major player in the criminal landscape of a post-FARC Colombia, remaining in the shadows and securing his power base in Nariño.
Allegedly
financed
by the Sinaloa Cartel, Contador made friends fast in drug trafficking circles. I
t is alleged that he first
funded
Yeison Segura Mina, alias “Don Y,” the founder of the group Gente del Orden, which later became the United Guerrillas of the Pacific (Guerrillas Unidas del Pacífico – GUP), a FARC dissident group.
Later,
Contador formed an alliance with Mario Cabezas, alias “Mario Lata,”
a former member of the FARC and Los Rastrojos drug gang, International Crisis Group reported. T
his alliance provided Contador armed men, as Mario Lata
convinced a local GUP commander
to join them and started to recruit with the promise of
better salaries
.
This was the origin of Los Contadores, as his army is known. The crime group currently stands at about
400
men, according to public security information obtained by El Tiempo.

Contador also is suspected of providing cash to Walter Patricio Arizala, alias
“Guacho,”
the leader of the Oliver Sinisterra Front (FOS), which operates on the Colombia-Ecuador border. In turn, Guacho provided
passage of drug shipments
to the Pacific Ocean through territory under his control in Nariño.
However, the alliance between Contador and Guacho
came to an end
when Guacho became a target for authorities after
murdering three journalists
from the Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio in April 2018.
After
Guacho’s killing
by the Colombian military in December 2018, FOS lost strategic territories to Los Contadores, including Llorente, Alto Mira and Frontera, located in south Tumaco.
The fight between the two groups continues to this day in the rural area of Tumaco, though a
non-aggression pact
exists between them in the urban areas.
The security situation in Nariño has now been further complicated by a breakaway
faction
of Guacho’s group that calls itself the Comandante Alfonso Cano Western Bloc and looks to
snatch control
of towns around Tumaco, including Olaya Herrera, Magüí Payán and Roberto Payán. In January 2020,
it was reported that at least
1,600 individuals
were forcibly displaced in the region.
Contador’s removal will likely only incite more violence as these groups battle for the territory formerly under his control.

Juan Diego Cárdenas ,"Guaviare has felt the brunt of worsened deforestation since the 2016 peace agreement with the FARC
SHARE
Recent investigations in Colombia have found that government leaders and landowners in Colombia’s department of Guaviare have teamed up to illegally deforest the Amazon in quest of mutual profit.
Last December,
the former mayors of Calamar and Miraflores, Pedro Pablo Novoa and Jhonivar Cumbe, were
arrested
after it was revealed that during their time in office, they had encouraged illegal deforestation in Guaviare in order to build a 138-kilometer highway between their towns.
The Attorney General’s Office issued whopping fines to the two mayors and former Guaviare governor, Nebio Echeverry, who is also implicated in the deforestation, the magazine
Semana
revealed.
SEE ALSO:
How Organized Crime Profits from Deforestation in Colombia
In addition, the TV program
Zona Franca
recently
exposed accelerated deforestation in Guaviare related to illicit crops, palm oil plantations and extensive ranching in territories like the savanna La Fuga. It also revealed Guaviare has the second-highest rate of deforestation in Colombia.
“What is happening is an illegal appropriation of the country’s uncultivated lands by individuals that have a lot of capital and are able to cut down 100 or 200 hectares of forest (at a time),”
said
Rodrigo Botero, an environmental expert that recently visited the zone.
Despite 90 percent of the department being protected, the environmental institute Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales – IDEAM)
reported
a rise in deforestation of at least 23.071 hectares between 2015 and 2018 with no end in sight.
InSight Crime Analysis
Guaviare is exemplary of how local interests can share a slice of the pie when it comes to deforestations. Criminal groups, entrepreneurs and politicians, everyone appears to benefit from the logging which is slowly destroying the Amazon rainforest.
Former governor Echeverry has been accused of being at the heart of a lot of it. According to documents from the Attorney General’s Office
quoted
by Semana, the highway he supported had “neither permits nor environmental licenses.”
Additionally, the continuous passage of heavy vehicles and illegal logging have only further damaged the protected land and water resources in the area. As a result, the governor’s office of Guaviare was
fined
over 1 billion pesos ($300,000).
Echeverry was
included
on the Clinton List between 2010 and 2015 and is believed to be close to businessmen Jorge Gaitán, Ramón Rojas and Saúl Aguirre, who all benefited from
lucrative
contracts
, according to
official records
from Echeverry’s time in office.
In a document from the Attorney General’s Office
presented
by Zona Franca, these individuals were able to appropriate huge tracts of land for their agro-industrial projects, in exchange for endorsing the former governor.
According to the document, large areas of land were appropriated to these individuals for high-impact agro-industrial projects that required deforesting the natural forest, in exchange for their endorsement of the former governor.

And government leaders are not the only ones guilty of profiting from deforestation. While the FARC used to have codes of conduct regarding deforestation, illegal logging and mining have
soared
since their 2016 demobilization.
And their successors, the ex-FARC Mafia, are all too happy to participate in deforestation, encouraging local farmers to do so, and extorting fees from large landowners,
according
to non-governmental organization Amazonia Socio Ambiental. The ex-FARC 7th Front and 40th Front were named as particular culprits.

SHARE
A tactical military-style operation allegedly carried out by suspected gang members succeeded in freeing a high-profile MS13 leader jailed in Honduras, but serious questions remain about who may have been involved in the audacious attack.
Some 20 heavily armed men dressed in uniforms of Honduras’ military police and National Anti-Gang Force (Fuerza Nacional Anti Maras y Pandillas — FNAMP) stormed the courthouse in the city of El Progreso in northern Yoro department and freed MS13 leader Alexander Mendoza, alias “El Porky,” on February 14, according to
security footage
of the attack.
Authorities had
arrested Mendoza
, a top Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) leader in the industrial hub of San Pedro Sula, in December of 2015 on various criminal charges, including murder. Then in April 2019, Mendoza was one of 12 “feared” gang leaders
transferred via helicopter
on the orders of President Juan Orlando Hernández to the US-style maximum-security prison known as La Tolva located in Morocelí municipality of El Paraíso department.
It’s not clear why Mendoza had been removed from there and taken to El Progreso.
SEE ALSO:
Honduras News and Profiles
Following the ordeal, authorities reportedly
uncovered a cache of weapons
believed to belong to the alleged material authors of the crime, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Among the items recovered were 35 high-powered weapons, 32 bulletproof vests, 19 handguns,
14 falsified FNAMP and military police
uniforms, as well as a grenade launcher, among other things.
The Attorney General’s Office has since zeroed in on three individuals alleged to be involved in the courthouse offensive, which killed four security force members in the process, according to an
official press release
. The Honduran government is
offering a reward
of two million lempiras (around $80,000) for information leading to Mendoza’s recapture.
“In an investigation of this magnitude, we do not discard any element and those responsible will be brought to justice,” said Security Minister Julián Pacheco Tinoco in a
government press release
, adding that the nation’s security forces are united and working together to ensure there won’t be impunity for the crime.
In an intelligence operation carried out days after the attack, the
FNAMP captured
one alleged MS13 member thought to have participated in freeing Mendoza. At least nine others alleged to be involved have also
reportedly been arrested
.
InSight Crime Analysis
A closer look at the takeover of the courthouse in El Progreso by alleged MS13 gang members raises far more questions than it answers.
First, by all accounts, Mendoza was a
prominent MS13 gang leader
in Honduras’ second-largest city, and authorities have treated him as such in the past. After already being sent to La Tolva maximum-security prison and receiving a
20-year sentence
for illicit association, authorities have yet to clarify why Mendoza was brought to El Progreso less than a year after his high-profile transfer.
What’s more, with the presence of such a high-ranking member of the MS13 — one of the government’s primary anti-gang targets — security surrounding the courthouse was woefully inadequate. Such targets have in the past been
accompanied by extra security
to mitigate the threat of any possible attack.
The style of the attack also did not appear to resemble the MS13’s work. While the gang has previously
sold high-powered weapons
, its members
rarely use them
nor have they shown an ability to carry out a coordinated attack with this level of sophistication.
Extortion is the
bedrock of the MS13’s operations
, but the group is also involved in petty drug dealing and other small-time crimes in the territories they control. More importantly, the gang has a
decentralized power structure
with no clear hierarchy, which raises questions about the group’s ability to carry out such an attack.
SEE ALSO:
MS13 in the Americas Investigation
To be sure, one of the most in-depth and far reaching indictments to hit the MS13, stemming from the so-called “Operación Jaque” (Operation Check), provided a trove of information on the gang. Much of it focused on the gang’s
financial networks
, extortion rackets and
money laundering operations
. Phone taps provided insight into the gang’s
attempts to acquire
a more advanced arsenal, but little on the gang actually being equipped with the type of weapons used in the attack in El Progreso.
In addition, while fake security force uniforms
have been used before
by other actors to carry out attacks in Honduras, the gang has not been known for such tactics. If they had access to such resources, it’s likely there would be more evidence of their use.
The courthouse debacle comes amid
considerable upheaval
within the country’s penitentiary system. Following
the conviction
of President Hernández’s brother, Tony, on drug charges in the United States, a number of individuals linked to the case — including two inmates housed in maximum-security facilities and the prison director of one of those prisons — were
brutally murdered
at the end of 2019.
Following these slayings, as well as the killing of
five other inmates
and a lawyer representing a drug trafficker who played a key role in Tony Hernández’s conviction, a
state of emergency
was declared in the prison system and control was
transferred to the armed forces
.
This extraordinary situation has not changed, raising questions about what role, if any, the armed forces may have played in the decision that brought Mendoza out of a maximum-security prison and to the low-security courthouse he was eventually freed from.

SHARE
Armed men shot and killed a Brazilian journalist who covered police and drug trafficking along the Brazil-Paraguay border, underscoring the precarious situation for reporters in a lawless region dominated by organized crime groups and rampant corruption.
Lourenço “Leo” Veras — who had assisted InSight Crime’s ongoing investigations in the area, as well as other foreign media — was killed the night of February 12 at his home in the border town of Pedro Juan Caballero in Paraguay’s eastern Amambay department,
ABC Color reported.
The three masked gunmen — who entered Veras’ home as he ate dinner with his family on their patio — shot him 12 times, primarily in the back and then a final shot to his head. Veras was taken to a private hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later, according to ABC Color.
On February 24, prosecutors in Paraguay said 10 suspects in the killing of Veras had been arrested — nine on criminal conspiracy and weapons charges, according to an
official news release
by the Attorney General’s Office. The
10 suspects included
six Paraguayans, three Brazilians and one Bolivian.

Paraguay News and Profile
Among those arrested was Cyntia Raquel Pereira, who is suspected of belonging to the First Capital Command (
Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC
), Prosecutor Marcelo Pecci said. He said Pereira had been sentenced previously to 10 years in prison in Brazil for drug trafficking and other crimes related to the PCC, a violent Brazilian gang that has gained a foothold in Paraguay.
A Jeep Renegade — seen on surveillance cameras on the night of the murder moving about downtown
Pedro Juan Caballero
— was later driven to her home, Brazilian news outlet
Estadão reported
. The Jeep was used by the gunmen, prosecutors said. The vehicle and several weapons — including four Glock pistols, two revolvers, and a shotgun — were seized by authorities during the arrests.
Prosecutors also said they have identified the gun used to kill Veras. Ballistic tests have shown that it had been used in other crimes,
said Pecci
, who is part of a special investigative unit dedicated to the case. Veras’ family members, who witnessed the killing, have also provided prosecutors with descriptions of the assailants.
It’s not yet clear why Veras was targeted, but the gunmen
reportedly
bound his mouth after he was shot, as if to send a message about the journalist’s work. A
s the director of
Porã News
and a freelance reporter for many media organizations in the border region for years, he had
received past threats
for covering the police and organized crime groups operating in Pedro Juan Caballero and Ponta Porã, which sits just across the border in Brazil’s Mato Grosso do Sul state.
“We urge authorities … to conduct a thorough investigation to find the murderers [and provide] immediate protection for colleagues in the area against the prevailing insecurity and lack of guarantees for reporters,” the Paraguayan Journalists Forum (Foro de Periodistas Paraguayos — FOPEP) said in a press release, according to ABC Color.
InSight Crime Analysis
Cases of murdered journalists are rare in Paraguay, but Veras’ killing brings the total number of reporters killed to 18 since the country’s transition to democracy in 1992,
La Nación reported
. What’s more, Reporters Without Borders, which tracts the killing of journalists worldwide, has
raised concerns
about a “worrying lack of progress” in ensuring the protection of journalists operating in the country.
The organization identified the border region with Brazil as being particularly dangerous for reporters who often come under attack from criminal organizations that benefit from a “climate of near-total impunity.”
Veras is not the only journalist along the Brazil-Paraguay border to be targeted. Cándido Figueredo, a correspondent for ABC Color, told InSight Crime on a recent field trip about the constant threats he faces from organized crime groups. Bullet holes from past attempts on his life marked the walls and doors of his home, which he now only leaves accompanied by private security.

Impunity Persists in LatAm Cases of Murdered Journalists
“There is a lot of fear, reporters are taking [Veras’ death] as if it was a wake-up call for everyone,” Blanca López of Paraguay’s C9N News told InSight Crime.
Veras’ murder follows the
dramatic January 2020 escape
of 76 PCC gang members from the Pedro Juan Caballero Regional Penitentiary. When authorities began recapturing some of those who had escaped weeks later, criminal groups apparently ordered local journalists to stop covering the case, López said.
Though its roots are in Brazil, the PCC
has spread into
Paraguay, especially in the border region. PCC gang members have also wreaked havoc in Paraguay’s prisons, using extreme violence
in its clashes
with other gangs and using the jails to recruit new members.
